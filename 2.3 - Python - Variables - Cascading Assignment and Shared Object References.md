When using cascading assignments, it's crucial to understand that all the variables involved refer to the same object in memory. This is true for both mutable and immutable types. Let's delve into this concept further:

### Immutable Types (e.g., int, string)

In the case of immutable types, such as integers and strings, when you perform cascading assignment, all the variables reference the same object. If you change the value of one variable, the others remain unaffected.

```python
a = b = c = 1  # All variables reference the same int object with value 1
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 1 1

b = 2  # 'b' now refers to another int object with a value of 2
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 1
```

### Mutable Types (e.g., list, dict)

The same principle applies to mutable types like lists. When you cascade-assign mutable objects, all variables refer to the same object in memory. Changing one variable will affect the shared object and consequently affect all variables referencing it.

```python
x = y = [7, 8, 9]  # Both variables reference the same list object [7, 8, 9]

x = [13, 8, 9]  # 'x' now refers to a different list object [13, 8, 9]
print(y)  # 'y' still refers to the original list [7, 8, 9]
```

In summary, when you use cascading assignment, all the variables involved point to the same object in memory. This behavior holds true for both immutable and mutable types. Understanding this principle is essential for avoiding unexpected behavior when modifying shared objects through different variable names.
