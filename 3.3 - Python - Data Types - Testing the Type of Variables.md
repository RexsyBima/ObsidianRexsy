## Testing Data Types in Python

In Python, you can determine the data type of an object using the built-in function `type()`:

```python
a = '123'
print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'str'>

b = 123
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

To test data types in conditional statements, you can use the `isinstance()` function:

```python
i = 7
if isinstance(i, int):
    i += 1
elif isinstance(i, str):
    i = int(i)
    i += 1
```

However, it's generally not encouraged to rely heavily on the data type of a variable. Instead, you should focus on ensuring that your code behaves correctly for different data types.

To check if something is of `NoneType`:

```python
x = None
if x is None:
    print("Not a surprise, I just defined x as None.")
```

Keep in mind that Python's dynamic typing allows variables to change types during runtime, so it's essential to design your code to handle various data types effectively.
