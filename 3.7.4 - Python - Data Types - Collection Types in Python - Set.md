## Sets in Python

A set is a data structure in Python that holds an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are often used when you want to ensure that you have a collection of distinct values, without any duplicates. Here's how you work with sets in Python:

### Creating Sets

You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or the built-in `set()` function:

```python
first_names = {'Adam', 'Beth', 'Charlie'}
```

Or by converting a list into a set:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_set = set(my_list)
```

### Checking Membership

You can check if an element is present in a set using the `in` keyword:

```python
if 'Adam' in first_names:
    print('Adam is in the set')
```

### Iterating Through a Set

You can iterate through the elements of a set using a loop:

```python
for name in first_names:
    print(name)
```

### Adding and Removing Elements

You can add elements to a set using the `.add()` method:

```python
first_names.add('David')
```

And you can remove elements using the `.remove()` method:

```python
first_names.remove('Beth')
```

### Set Operations

Sets support various set operations such as union, intersection, and difference:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

union_set = set1.union(set2)        # Union of set1 and set2
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # Intersection of set1 and set2
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)      # Difference between set1 and set2
```

### Set Comprehension

You can also use set comprehension to create sets using a compact syntax:

```python
squared_numbers = {x * x for x in range(10)}
```

Sets are useful when you want to work with unique elements and perform efficient membership tests.
