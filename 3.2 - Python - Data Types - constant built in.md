## Built-in Constants in Python

In addition to the built-in data types, Python provides several built-in constants that are available in the built-in namespace:

### Booleans

- `True`: The true value of the built-in type `bool`.
- `False`: The false value of the built-in type `bool`.

### Special Values

- `None`: A singleton object used to indicate the absence of a value. It can be assigned to variables as a placeholder.
  ```python
  a = None  # No value assigned yet; can be assigned a valid datatype later
  ```

- `Ellipsis` or `...`: Used in core Python 3+ anywhere and limited usage in Python 2.7+. In packages like NumPy, it's used as a reference to 'include everything' in arrays.

- `NotImplemented`: A singleton used to indicate that a special method doesn't support specific arguments. Python will try alternatives if available.

### Ordering and `None`

In Python 3.x (3.0 and above):

- `None` doesn't have a natural ordering. Using ordering comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`) with `None` is not supported and will raise a `TypeError`.

In Python 2.x (2.7 and below):

- `None` is always considered less than any number. For example, `None < -32` evaluates to `True`.

These built-in constants play a significant role in various operations and comparisons within your Python code.
