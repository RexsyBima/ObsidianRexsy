### Modifying Shared Mutable Objects

When it comes to modifying shared mutable objects through cascading assignment, the behavior is consistent. Both variables refer to the same object in memory, so any modifications made to the object using one variable will be reflected when using the other.

```python
x = y = [7, 8, 9]  # x and y refer to the same list object [7, 8, 9]

x[0] = 13  # Update the value of the list through variable 'x'
print(y)  # The change is reflected in variable 'y'
# Output: [13, 8, 9]
```

### Nested Lists

Python allows nested lists, where a list can contain another list as an element:

```python
x = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, 7]  # This is a nested list

print(x[2])      # Output: [3, 4, 5]
print(x[2][1])   # Output: 4
```

### Dynamic Typing

Python's dynamic typing allows variables to change their type during their lifetime. You can reassign a new value of a different type to a variable:

```python
a = 2
print(a)  # Output: 2

a = "New value"
print(a)  # Output: New value
```

Remember that variables are essentially names for objects. When you use the assignment operator `=`, you're associating the name with an object. So, reassigning the name to a different type of object is a natural part of Python's dynamic typing system.
