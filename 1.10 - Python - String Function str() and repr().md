Both str() and repr() are used to obtain a readable representation of an object. 

## Understanding `repr()`
- Calls `x.__repr__()`.
- Aims to return a string that can be converted back to the original object using `eval()`.
- If it can't achieve that, the representation is a string within angle brackets showing the type of the object and possibly its name and address.

**Example**:
```python
s = """w'o"w"""
repr(s)  # Output: '\'w\\\'o"w\''
```

---

## Understanding `str()`
- Calls `x.__str__()`.
- Returns a human-readable string that describes the object, possibly omitting technical details.
- For strings, it returns the string itself. The goal is a 'human readable' string.

**Example**:
```python
s = """w'o"w"""
str(s)  # Output: 'w\'o"w'
```

## Distinction in Use

The difference between `str(object)` and `repr(object)`:
- `str(object)` doesn't always aim to produce a string acceptable to `eval()`.
- `repr(object)` does.

```python
eval(str(s)) == s  # Gives a SyntaxError
eval(repr(s)) == s  # Output: True
```

---

## Another Example

```python
import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.now()
str(today)  # Output: '2016-09-15 06:58:46.915000'
repr(today)  # Output: 'datetime.datetime(2016, 9, 15, 6, 58, 46, 915000)'
```

## Overriding in Classes

You can customize the behavior of `str()` and `repr()` for your classes:

```python
class Represent(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y
    def __repr__(self):
        return "Represent(x={},y=\"{}\")".format(self.x, self.y)
    def __str__(self):
        return "Representing x as {} and y as {}".format(self.x, self.y)

r = Represent(1, "Hopper")
print(r)  # prints __str__
print(r.__repr__)  # prints __repr__: '<bound method Represent.__repr__ of Represent(x=1,y="Hopper")>'
rep = r.__repr__()  
print(rep)  # prints 'Represent(x=1,y="Hopper")'
r2 = eval(rep)  
print(r2)  # prints __str__ from new object
print(r2 == r)  # prints 'False' because they are different objects
```
