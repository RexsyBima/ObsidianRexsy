diminish value of marginal utility
The concept of diminishing marginal utility refers to the economic principle that as a person consumes more and more units of a specific good or service, the additional satisfaction or utility derived from each additional unit tends to decrease.

In simpler terms, it means that the more you have of something, the less satisfaction you tend to get from each additional unit. For example, imagine you are eating a slice of pizza. The first slice might give you a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction, but as you continue eating more slices, the enjoyment you get from each additional slice diminishes. Eventually, you may reach a point where you feel full or even start to feel sick, and the utility of consuming additional slices becomes negative.

This concept is essential in understanding consumer behavior and helps explain why individuals allocate their resources or make choices in a certain way. It suggests that people tend to prioritize their consumption based on their preferences and the diminishing marginal utility they experience from each additional unit of a good or service.

The law of diminishing marginal utility is closely related to the concept of demand, as it helps explain why people are willing to pay less for each additional unit of a good. It also has implications for pricing strategies, as businesses typically adjust prices to align with consumers' diminishing marginal utility to maximize their profits.

It's important to note that the concept of diminishing marginal utility is a simplifying assumption in economic models and does not capture all aspects of consumer behavior. Additionally, the degree to which marginal utility diminishes can vary between individuals and circumstances.
