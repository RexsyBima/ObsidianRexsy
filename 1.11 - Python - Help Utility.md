**Help Utility in Python**

Python's interpreter is rich with built-in functions, and one of the most valuable among them is the `help` utility. This tool serves as a quick reference to gain insights into keywords, built-in functions, modules, and topics.

---

**Basic Usage:**

To activate the help utility, simply enter the Python console and type:
```python
>>> help()
```

For specific insights regarding a particular keyword or function, execute:
```python
>>> help(help)
```
You can also fetch details from within the help utility itself:
```python
help> help
```

---

**Interpreting the Output:**

Executing the above commands will yield an explanation similar to the following:
```python
Help on _Helper in module _sitebuiltins object:
class _Helper(builtins.object)
...
```

Here, you'll find a detailed breakdown of the function or keyword in question, including its definition, associated methods, and data descriptors.

---

**Exploring Modules:**

If you're curious about the subclasses of a module, you can prompt:
```python
help(pymysql.connections)
```

Remember, to access the docstrings of different modules you've imported, ensure the module is imported first. For instance, invoking:
```python
>>> help(math)
```
will result in an error if the `math` module isn't imported beforehand. After importing it with:
```python
>>> import math
>>> help(math)
```
You'll be presented with a list of methods available in the module.

---

**Exiting the Help Utility:**

When you're done, gracefully exit the help utility with:
```python
quit
```
