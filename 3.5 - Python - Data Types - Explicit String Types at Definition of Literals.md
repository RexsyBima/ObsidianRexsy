## Explicit String Types at Definition of Literals

When defining string literals, you can use prefixes to specify the desired string type. This is particularly relevant when you want to create bytes, strings, or raw strings.

- `b'foo bar'`: In Python 3, this results in bytes. In Python 2, it results in str.
- `u'foo bar'`: In Python 3, this results in str. In Python 2, it results in unicode.
- `'foo bar'`: This results in a str in both Python 2 and 3.
- `r'foo bar'`: This creates a raw string where special characters are not escaped. Everything is taken verbatim as you typed.
  ```python
  normal = 'foo\nbar'   # foo followed by newline, then bar
  escaped = 'foo\\nbar'  # foo\nbar
  raw = r'foo\nbar'      # foo\nbar
  ```

Using these prefixes allows you to explicitly define the string type and how special characters are handled, making it easier to work with various string representations in your code.
