## Verifying Python Installation

To ensure that Python has been installed correctly on your system, you can perform the following steps. If you're using the Windows operating system, make sure to add the path to the Python executable to your environment variables before using it in the command prompt.

### Python 3.x Installation Verification

Open your preferred terminal and enter the following command:

```sh
$ python --version
```

If you have Python 3 installed and it is set as your default version (for troubleshooting details, refer to the relevant section), you should observe an output similar to this:

```sh
Python 3.6.0
```

### Python 2.x Installation Verification

If you have Python 2 installed and it is your default version, execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
$ python --version
```

You should see an output resembling this:

```sh
Python 2.7.13
```

### Python 3.x Version Coexisting with Python 2.x

In certain cases, such as MacOS or various Linux distributions, you might find that the `python` command defaults to Python 2 even though you have Python 3 installed. In this situation, executing `$ python --version` would display a Python 2 version.

To explicitly use the Python 3 interpreter, utilize the following command:

```sh
$ python3 --version
```

This will provide output similar to:

```sh
Python 3.8.2
```

By employing `python3` instead of `python`, you ensure that the Python 3 interpreter is being utilized.

Remember, verifying your Python installation is crucial to ensure that you are using the correct version of Python for your programming needs.
