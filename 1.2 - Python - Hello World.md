## Hello, World in Python using IDLE

IDLE is a straightforward editor that comes bundled with Python, allowing you to create and execute Python programs. Here's how you can create a "Hello, World" program in IDLE:

1. **Open IDLE:**
   Open IDLE on your chosen system. The process may vary depending on your operating system:

   - On older versions of Windows, you can find IDLE under the "All Programs" section in the Windows menu.
   - For Windows 8 and later, search for "IDLE" or locate it in your installed apps.
   - On Unix-based systems like macOS, open the terminal and type: `$ idle python_file.py`

   This will open a shell with various options at the top.

2. **Accessing the Shell:**
   In the shell, you will see a prompt with three right-angle brackets: `>>>`

3. **Writing the Code:**
   Type the following code at the prompt and press Enter:

   ```python
   >>> print("Hello, World")
   ```

   You should see the output `Hello, World` displayed in the shell.

4. **Creating a Python File:**
   Alternatively, you can create a Python file named `hello.py` containing the following code:

   For Python 3.x:
   ```python
   print('Hello, World')
   ```

   For Python 2.x (using Python 3 print function):
   ```python
   from __future__ import print_function
   print('Hello, World')
   ```

   For Python 2.x (using Python 2 print syntax):
   ```python
   print 'Hello, World'
   ```

5. **Running the Python File:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `hello.py` file is located. Then type the following command and press Enter:

   ```sh
   $ python hello.py
   ```

   You should see the output `Hello, World` printed to the console.

   If your `hello.py` file is located in a different directory, you can specify the full path to the file in the command.

   For example, if your file is in the home directory and your username is "user" on Linux:

   ```sh
   $ python /home/user/hello.py
   ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to create and execute a "Hello, World" program using the IDLE editor in Python.
