In Python, creating variables and assigning values is a straightforward process. To define a variable, you simply specify the variable name followed by the assignment operator (=) and the desired value. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require variable declarations or explicit data type assignments.

### Integer Variables

You can create integer variables as follows:

```python
a = 2
print(a)  # Output: 2

b = 9223372036854775807
print(b)  # Output: 9223372036854775807
```

### Floating Point Variables

Floating point variables can be defined in the same way:

```python
pi = 3.14
print(pi)  # Output: 3.14
```

### String Variables

String variables can hold text or characters:

```python
c = 'A'
print(c)  # Output: A

name = 'John Doe'
print(name)  # Output: John Doe
```

### Boolean Variables

For Boolean values:

```python
q = True
print(q)  # Output: True
```

### Empty or Null Variables

To represent an empty value or a null data type:

```python
x = None
print(x)  # Output: None
```

It's important to note that variable assignment in Python works from left to right. Assigning a value to a literal (e.g., `0 = x`) will result in a syntax error:

```python
0 = x  # Output: SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
```

By following these patterns, you can create and assign values to variables in Python without the need for explicit type declarations.
