**Single line, inline, and multiline comments**

In Python, comments are used for describing or explaining the code to make it more readable and understandable. The Python interpreter ignores the comments.

- **Single-line Comment**: Starts with a hash character (#).

  ```python
  # This is a single line comment.
  ```

- **Inline Comment**: A comment that is placed on the same line as a statement.

  ```python
  print("Hello World")  # This comment describes the following code.
  ```

- **Multiline Comment**: Uses triple quotes (either ''' or """). Although this is technically a multiline string, it can be used as a comment if not assigned to a variable or otherwise used in an expression.

  ```python
  """
  This is a multiline comment.
  It spans several lines.
  """

  # or

  '''
  Another example of a
  multiline comment.
  '''
  ```

**Programmatically accessing docstrings**

Docstrings are special comments that are retained at runtime, allowing for introspection. They're used for providing explanations or documentation for a function, class, module, or method.

- **Accessing a Docstring**: Using the `__doc__` attribute.

  ```python
  def example_function():
      """This is the function's docstring."""
      pass

  print(example_function.__doc__)
  # Output: This is the function's docstring.
  ```

- **Using the `help()` function**: It displays a function's docstring along with other details.

  ```python
  help(example_function)
  ```

- **Defining Docstrings**: They are defined using triple quotes (either ''' or """).

  ```python
  def greet_user(name):
      """Greets the user with the provided name."""
      print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  ```

- **Advantages of Docstrings**:
  
  1. **Introspection**: Docstrings can be accessed at runtime.
  2. **Standardized**: Used by tools like Sphinx to auto-generate documentation.
  3. **More Informative**: They're designed to explain the purpose and usage of functions, classes, etc., making the code more understandable.

**Write documentation using docstrings**

Docstrings are essential for providing detailed explanations, usage examples, and other necessary information about functions, modules, and classes in Python.

- **Basic Usage**:

  ```python
  def hello(name):
      """Greet someone.
      Print a greeting ("Hello") for the person with the given name.
      """
      print("Hello " + name)
  ```

  Docstrings, as shown above, start and end with triple quotes (`"""`). They can be accessed programmatically via the `__doc__` attribute of the function or class.

- **Syntax conventions**:
  
  - **PEP 257**: This PEP provides conventions for writing docstrings in Python, and it classifies docstrings into two main categories:

    1. **One-line Docstrings**: These are concise and describe functionality in one line. E.g:

      ```python
      def hello():
          """Say hello to your friends."""
          print("Hello my friends!")
      ```

    2. **Multi-line Docstrings**: These docstrings cater to complex functions and provide detailed descriptions. They can include arguments, return types, exceptions, and other details.

      ```python
      def hello(name, language="en"):
          """Say hello to a person.
          
          Arguments:
          name: the name of the person
          language: the language in which the person should be greeted
          """
          print("Hello, " + name + "!")
      ```

- **Advanced docstring standards**:

  Different organizations and tools may have their unique standards for docstrings. Some popular standards are:

  - **Sphinx**: A powerful tool for generating detailed documentation. It uses reStructuredText as its markup language. Example:

    ```python
    def hello(name, language="en"):
        """Say hello to a person.
        
        :param name: the name of the person
        :type name: str
        :param language: the language in which the person should be greeted
        :type language: str
        :return: a greeting message
        :rtype: str
        """
        return "Hello, " + name + "!"
    ```

  - **Google Python Style Guide**: Offers a different style that many find more human-readable. E.g:

    ```python
    def hello(name, language="en"):
        """Say hello to a person.
        
        Args:
        name (str): the name of the person
        language (str): the language in which the person should be greeted
        
        Returns:
        str: A greeting message.
        """
        return "Hello, " + name + "!"
    ```

    With the Napoleon Sphinx extension, Sphinx can also parse Google-style docstrings.

**In Summary**:
comments and docstrings play a crucial role in making Python code more readable and maintainable. While regular comments are discarded by the interpreter, docstrings are retained and can be accessed programmatically, making them ideal for providing documentation that can be leveraged by both developers and various tools.

Docstrings are a powerful way to describe the functionality and usage of Python components. Their accessibility at runtime allows for introspection and aids in building well-documented projects. Adhering to established standards ensures consistency and clarity across the Python community.
