**Installing External Modules Using pip**

`pip` is a powerful tool that allows you to easily install and manage external Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `pip` to install external modules:

If you're using Python 2 >= 2.7.9 or Python 3 >= 3.4 downloaded from python.org, `pip` comes pre-installed. For systems like Linux or other *nix platforms with native package managers, pip might need manual installation.

When both Python 2 and Python 3 are installed:
- `pip` typically refers to Python 2 
- `pip3` refers to Python 3

Consequently:
- Using `pip` will only install packages for Python 2
- `pip3` will only install packages for Python 3

**Finding / Installing a Package**
Search for a package:
```python
$ pip search <query>
```
(Note: Searches for packages whose name or summary contains `<query>`)

Install a package:
```python
$ pip install [package_name]          # latest version
$ pip install [package_name]==x.x.x   # specific version
$ pip install '[package_name]>=x.x.x' # minimum version
```
If behind a proxy server:
```python
$ pip --proxy http://<server address>:<port> install
```

**Upgrading Installed Packages**
Check for outdated packages:
```python
$ pip list --outdated
```
Upgrade a specific package:
```python
$ pip install [package_name] --upgrade
```
(Note: Updating all outdated packages isn't a standard pip function)

**Upgrading pip**

On Linux or macOS X:
```python
$ pip install -U pip
```
(Note: You might need `sudo` with `pip` on some Linux systems)

On Windows:
```python
py -m pip install -U pip
```
or
```python
python -m pip install -U pip
```
