**Section 3.2: How Indentation is Parsed**

Whitespace in Python plays a crucial role as it determines the structure of the code blocks. However, the way this whitespace is processed is often overlooked.

---

- **Initial Handling of Whitespace**:
  
  Before the Python code gets parsed, whitespace is processed by the lexical analyzer. This is the stage where the code's indentation levels are identified and used to determine the code's structure.

- **Stack for Indentation Levels**:

  The lexical analyzer utilizes a stack to keep track of indentation levels. At the very beginning, this stack only contains the value 0, signifying the leftmost position. When a new indented block is introduced, its indentation level is pushed onto the stack, and an "INDENT" token is added to the stream of tokens sent to the parser. It's important to note that there can never be two "INDENT" tokens consecutively; such an occurrence would lead to an IndentationError.

- **Handling Reduced Indentation**:

  If the lexical analyzer comes across a line with lesser indentation than the previous line, it pops values off the stack until it finds a value matching the new indentation level. If it doesn't find a match, a syntax error is thrown. For each value popped off the stack, a "DEDENT" token is produced. Contrary to "INDENT" tokens, it's possible to have multiple consecutive "DEDENT" tokens.

- **Empty Lines**:

  Lines that contain only whitespace (and possibly comments) are skipped by the lexical analyzer. Such lines won't result in the generation of either "INDENT" or "DEDENT" tokens.

- **End of Source Code**:

  When the end of the source code is reached, "DEDENT" tokens are produced for each remaining indentation level on the stack, until only the initial 0 value remains.

For illustration, consider the following code snippet:

```python
if foo:
    if bar:
        x = 42
else:
    print(foo)
```

This is tokenized as:

```
<if> <foo> <:>
<INDENT> <if> <bar> <:>
<INDENT> <x> <=> <42>
<DEDENT> <DEDENT> <else> <:>
<INDENT> <print> <foo>
<DEDENT>
```

The numbers in square brackets ([0], [0, 4], etc.) that you provided in the original representation represent the state of the indentation stack after each line. The parser than handles the "INDENT" and "DEDENT" tokens as block delimiters.
