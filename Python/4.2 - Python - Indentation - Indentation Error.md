In Python, proper indentation is crucial for defining the structure of code blocks. If your code is not indented correctly, you'll either get an IndentationError or the code might execute in a way you didn't intend.

**1. Mismatched Indentation**

In cases where the indentation doesn't match the expected levels, an `IndentationError` is thrown. Consider the following example:

```python
a = 7
if a > 5:
 print "foo"
else:
 print "bar"
print "done"
```

The `print "foo"` and `print "bar"` lines aren't correctly indented under their respective `if` and `else` statements. The interpreter expects them to be indented by one level.

---

**2. No Indentation After a Colon**

Anytime you introduce a new block with a colon, the following line must be indented. Failure to do so will result in an `IndentationError`. 

```python
if True:
print "true"
```

Here, `print "true"` should be indented.

---

**3. Excess Indentation**

Introducing indentation where it's not required can also result in an `IndentationError`. 

```python
if True:
 a = 6
  b = 5
```

Here, `b = 5` is indented more than it should be, causing an error.

---

**4. Incorrect Un-indentation Causing Lost Functionality**

If you don't correctly un-indent lines, some parts of your code might not execute under the conditions you intended.

```python
def isEven(a):
 if a%2 == 0:
 return True
 # The following line should be even with the if
 return False

print(isEven(7))
```

In this case, the `return False` statement should be at the same level as the `if` statement. Since it's not, the function will always return `True` if the condition is met and `None` otherwise, instead of the intended behavior of returning `False` when the condition isn't met.

Remember, consistent indentation is not just for aesthetics in Pythonâ€”it's a fundamental part of the language's syntax.
