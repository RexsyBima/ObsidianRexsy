## Converting Between Data Types in Python

Python provides functions to explicitly convert between different data types. Here's how you can perform datatype conversion:

### Converting to Numeric Types

- `int()`: Converts a string or float to an integer.
  ```python
  a = '123'
  b = int(a)  # b is now an integer
  ```

- `float()`: Converts a string or integer to a floating-point number.
  ```python
  a = '123.456'
  b = float(a)  # b is now a float
  ```

### Converting to Sequence or Collection Types

- `list()`: Converts a sequence (string, tuple, etc.) to a list.
  ```python
  a = 'hello'
  b = list(a)  # b is a list containing ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
  ```

- `set()`: Converts a sequence (string, tuple, etc.) to a set (unordered collection of unique values).
  ```python
  a = 'hello'
  b = set(a)  # b is a set containing {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}
  ```

- `tuple()`: Converts a sequence (string, list, etc.) to a tuple (ordered collection).
  ```python
  a = 'hello'
  b = tuple(a)  # b is a tuple containing ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
  ```

Keep in mind that conversion between data types should be done carefully, as it might lead to data loss or unexpected behavior. It's important to understand the semantics of the target data type and how it will handle the converted value.
