## Tuples in Python

Tuples are another type of collection in Python. They are similar to lists but have some key differences:

- Tuples are fixed-length, meaning their size cannot change after creation.
- Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned.

Here's how you define and use tuples in Python:

### Creating Tuples

You create a tuple by enclosing values, separated by commas, in parentheses:

```python
ip_address = ('10.20.30.40', 8080)
```

### Indexing Tuples

Just like lists, tuples are zero-indexed, and you can access their elements using index numbers:

```python
print(ip_address[0])  # Output: '10.20.30.40'
print(ip_address[1])  # Output: 8080
```

### Nested Tuples

You can nest tuples inside each other:

```python
nested_tuple = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
print(nested_tuple[0][0])  # Output: 1
print(nested_tuple[1][1])  # Output: 4
```

### Single-Element Tuples

If you want to create a tuple with a single element, you need to add a comma after the element:

```python
single_element_tuple = ('Only member',)
print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: ('Only member',)
```

You can also create a single-element tuple without using parentheses:

```python
single_element_tuple = 'Only member',
print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: ('Only member',)
```

### Immutable Nature of Tuples

Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its elements. Attempting to do so will result in an error:

```python
ip_address[0] = '20.30.40.50'  # This will raise an error
```

Tuples are commonly used when you need to group together a fixed set of values that shouldn't be changed throughout the program's execution.
