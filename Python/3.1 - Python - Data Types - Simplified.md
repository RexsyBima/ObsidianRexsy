**Understanding Data Types in Python**

In Python, data types are essentially variables utilized to allocate memory space. One of the significant advantages of Python is that there's no need for an explicit declaration to reserve this memory space. Instead, this reservation is done automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.

**String Data Type**

Strings are characterized as a contiguous collection of characters enclosed within quotation marks. Python accommodates both single and double quotes. It's essential to note that strings are immutable, meaning that every time a change is made to a string, a brand-new string object is instantiated.

Example:
```python
a_str = 'Hello World'
print(a_str)        # Output: Hello World
print(a_str[0])     # Output: H
print(a_str[0:5])   # Output: Hello
```

**Set Data Types**

Sets in Python are unordered collections of distinct elements. There are two primary types of sets:

1. **Sets**: These are mutable, implying that you can add new elements to them once they're defined.

Example:
```python
basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}
print(basket)       # Output: {'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}
a = set('abracadabra')
print(a)            # Output: {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
a.add('z')
print(a)            # Output: {'a', 'c', 'r', 'b', 'z', 'd'}
```

2. **Frozen Sets**: These are immutable, meaning new elements cannot be added after it's been defined.

Example:
```python
b = frozenset('asdfagsa')
print(b)            # Output: frozenset({'f', 'g', 'd', 'a', 's'})
cities = frozenset(["Frankfurt", "Basel","Freiburg"])
print(cities)       # Output: frozenset({'Frankfurt', 'Basel', 'Freiburg'})
```

**Numbers Data Type**

Python comprises four distinct types when dealing with numbers: Int, Float, Complex, and Long.

Example:
```python
int_num = 10        # int value
float_num = 10.2    # float value
complex_num = 3.14j # complex value
long_num = 1234567L # long value (Note: 'long' type is specific to Python 2 and doesn't exist in Python 3)
```

**List Data Type**

A list in Python is a collection of items separated by commas, all enclosed within square brackets `[]`. It resembles arrays in languages like C, but with a crucial difference: lists can contain items of diverse data types.

Example:
```python
list_example = [123, 'abcd', 10.2, 'd']  
list1 = ['hello', 'world']
print(list_example)              # Output: [123, 'abcd', 10.2, 'd']
print(list_example[0:2])        # Output: [123, 'abcd']
print(list1 * 2)                # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'hello', 'world']
print(list_example + list1)     # Output: [123, 'abcd', 10.2, 'd', 'hello', 'world']
```

**Dictionary Data Type**

Dictionaries in Python are a collection of key-value pairs. They are enclosed by curly braces `{}`, with values accessed and assigned using square brackets `[]`.

Example:
```python
dic = {'name': 'red', 'age': 10}
print(dic)                      # Output: {'name': 'red', 'age': 10}
print(dic['name'])              # Output: 'red'
print(dic.values())             # Output: ['red', 10]
print(dic.keys())               # Output: ['name', 'age']
```

---

**Tuple Data Type**

While lists are mutable and enclosed in square brackets `[]`, tuples are immutable and enclosed in parentheses `()`. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified.

Example:
```python
tuple_example = (123, 'hello')
tuple1 = ('world',)
print(tuple_example)            # Output: (123, 'hello')
print(tuple_example[0])         # Output: 123
print(tuple_example + tuple1)   # Output: (123, 'hello', 'world')
# tuple_example[1] = 'update'  This will result in an error.
```

> Note: When defining a tuple with a single item, ensure to place a comma after the item, as shown in `tuple1`, to differentiate it from being considered as just a grouped expression.
