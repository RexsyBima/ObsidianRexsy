Python's use of indentation to define control and loop constructs contributes to its readability. However, it requires careful attention to whitespace, as indentation errors can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Indentation and Code Blocks

Python uses the colon symbol (`:`) to indicate the beginning of a code block, followed by an indented block of code. Blocks in Python, such as functions, loops, if clauses, and other constructs, have no explicit ending identifiers. The block starts with a colon and contains the indented lines below it.

For example:

```python
def my_function():  # This is a function definition. Note the colon (:)
    a = 2  # This line belongs to the function because it's indented
    return a  # This line also belongs to the same function

print(my_function())  # This line is OUTSIDE the function block
```

Or for an if-else construct:

```python
if a > b:  # If block starts here
    print(a)  # This is part of the if block
else:  # else must be at the same level as if
    print(b)  # This line is part of the else block
```

### Single-Line Blocks

Blocks containing a single-line statement can be written on the same line, although this style is generally not recommended:

```python
if a > b: print(a)
else: print(b)
```

However, you cannot use this style with multiple statements:

```python
if x > y: y = x
    print(y)  # IndentationError: unexpected indent

if x > y:
    while y != z:
        y -= 1  # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

### Empty Blocks

If you have an empty block, you can use the `pass` statement, which does nothing, to avoid an IndentationError:

```python
def will_be_implemented_later():
    pass
```

### Spaces vs. Tabs

It's recommended to use spaces for indentation. PEP 8, Python's style guide, prefers spaces over tabs. Specifically, use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.

Python 3 disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation. In Python 2, mixing tabs and spaces is allowed but discouraged. Using tabs can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if editors display tabs as multiples of 4 spaces, causing inconsistencies between how code appears and how it's interpreted.
