Modules are an essential part of Python programming. They provide a way to organize and reuse code across multiple scripts.

## What is a Module?
- A module is an **importable file** containing definitions and statements.
- A module can be created by creating a `.py` file.

For instance:
```python
# hello.py
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
```

---

## Using Modules
- Functions in a module can be accessed by importing the module.
- For modules you've created, they should be in the same directory as the file you're importing them into. (Alternatively, they can be placed in the Python `lib` directory alongside pre-included modules, but this is typically discouraged.)

```python
$ python
>>> import hello
>>> hello.say_hello()
Hello!
```

## Importing Modules in Different Ways
1. **Whole Module**: Modules can be imported by other modules.
    ```python
    # greet.py
    import hello
    hello.say_hello()
    ```
    
2. **Specific Functions**: Instead of importing an entire module, specific functions can be imported.
    ```python
    # greet.py
    from hello import say_hello
    say_hello()
    ```
    
3. **Aliasing**: Modules can be given an alias to make calling them more concise.
    ```python
    # greet.py
    import hello as ai
    ai.say_hello()
    ```

---

## Making a Module Runnable
A module can also function as a stand-alone runnable script.
```python
# run_hello.py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    from hello import say_hello
    say_hello()

# When executed:
$ python run_hello.py
Hello!
```

## Directories with Modules
If a module is inside a directory and needs to be detected by Python, ensure that the directory contains a file named `__init__.py`.
