## Mutable and Immutable Data Types in Python

In Python, data types are classified into two categories based on whether the objects they represent are mutable or immutable.

### Mutable Data Types

An object is considered mutable if its state can be changed after it is created. Here are some examples of mutable data types:

- `list`: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements after creation.
- `set`: Sets are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, and modify their elements.
- `dict`: Dictionaries are mutable collections of key-value pairs.
- `bytearray`: Similar to bytes, but mutable. You can change the values of individual bytes.

### Immutable Data Types

An object is considered immutable if its state cannot be changed after creation. Here are some examples of immutable data types:

- `int`, `float`, `complex`: Numeric data types like integers, floats, and complex numbers are immutable.
- `str`: Strings are immutable; you cannot modify their characters after they are created.
- `tuple`: Tuples are immutable ordered collections.
- `frozenset`: Similar to sets, but immutable. Once created, you cannot change its elements.

### Examples

#### Mutable Data Types Example:

```python
def modify_list(lst):
    lst.append(3)  # This modifies the list

my_list = [1, 2]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Immutable Data Types Example:

```python
def modify_tuple(tup):
    # This function doesn't modify the tuple; it returns a new tuple
    return tup + (3,)

my_tuple = (1, 2)
new_tuple = modify_tuple(my_tuple)
print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2)
print(new_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

Understanding whether a data type is mutable or immutable is important for managing data and ensuring the behavior of your code matches your intentions.
