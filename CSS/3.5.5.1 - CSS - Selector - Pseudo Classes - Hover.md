Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of the `:hover` pseudo-class.

The `:hover` pseudo-class in CSS applies a style to an element when the user hovers their mouse over it.

For example, suppose you have a button in your HTML:

```html
<button class="hover-button">Hover over me!</button>
```

You could use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the background color of the button when the user hovers over it. Here's how you would do it in your CSS:

```css
.hover-button {
    background-color: blue; /* original color */
    color: white; /* text color */
    padding: 10px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.hover-button:hover {
    background-color: red; /* color when hovered */
}
```

In the above CSS, the button's background color is originally blue. When you hover over it, the `:hover` pseudo-class gets activated and changes the background color to red. When you stop hovering over it, the button reverts to its original state.
