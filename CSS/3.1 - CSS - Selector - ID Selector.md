An ID selector in CSS is a powerful way to target a single, unique element. An ID is defined in HTML using the `id` attribute, and in CSS, you can select an element by its ID by preceding the ID with a hash (`#`) symbol.

Remember, the ID must be unique within the document â€” it should only be used once per page. This is a rule you must strictly follow. The ID is used not only by CSS but also by JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

Here is an example of how to use an ID to target a single element:

HTML:
```html
<div id="uniqueElement">This is a unique element!</div>
```

CSS:
```css
#uniqueElement {
    color: white;
    background-color: blue;
    border: 2px solid red;
}
```

In this example, the styles defined in the `#uniqueElement` rule will only apply to the div with the id "uniqueElement". Any other divs or elements on the page will not be affected by this rule, even if they have the same tag (like another div) or class.

ID selectors have a high specificity value. This means that if you have other selectors (like element or class selectors) that set the same properties on the same element, the styles defined by the ID selector will take precedence because they are more specific.

That being said, it's generally recommended to use classes for styling in CSS, and reserve the use of IDs for JavaScript. This is because classes are more reusable and efficient for styling, while IDs are powerful for manipulating single, unique elements in JavaScript. However, this isn't a hard rule, and there are cases where you might want to use IDs for styling.

One thing to note: IDs should not start with a number. Although it is valid in HTML5, it is still invalid in CSS, and might cause some cross-browser compatibility issues.
