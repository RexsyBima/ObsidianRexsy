In CSS, "styling" refers to the process of defining the look and feel of a web page. More specifically, it's about setting the visual properties of HTML elements.

A style sheet consists of a list of rules, with each rule consisting of one or more selectors, and a declaration block. In the declaration block, you can define various stylistic properties for the selectors, such as color, font, layout, and much more.

Here's an example of a CSS rule:

```css
p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

In this rule, `p` is the selector, and the declarations are `color: green;` and `font-size: 18px;`. This rule will make the text color of all paragraph elements (`<p>`) green and their font size 18 pixels.

You can style almost any visual aspect of an HTML element with CSS. Here are just a few of the many properties you can set:

- `color`: The text color. [[2.1 - CSS - Styling - Color]]
- `background-color`: The background color of an element.
- `font-size`: The size of the text.
- `font-family`: The typeface of the text.
- `width` and `height`: The width and height of an element.
- `border`: The border around an element.
- `margin`: The space around an element, outside of any defined borders.
- `padding`: The space around the content within an element, inside of any defined borders.
- `display`: The display type of an element, which determines how it flows with elements around it.
- `position`: The positioning scheme used to lay out an element.

Styling with CSS is very powerful and flexible. You can apply styles to elements in a variety of ways, such as inline directly in the HTML, embedded within the HTML document, or linked externally in a separate CSS file. The last approach is generally considered the best practice because it separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making your code easier to manage and maintain.

CSS also has advanced features for more sophisticated styling, such as animations, gradients, transitions, and transformations. You can even create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes using media queries. 

The possibilities with CSS are vast, and the above is just a basic overview. But I hope it helps you to start understanding the concept of styling in CSS.
