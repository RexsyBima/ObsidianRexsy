In CSS, you can group multiple selectors together that share the same style declarations to make your code more concise and easier to manage. This is known as "grouping selectors". By grouping selectors, you're applying the same styles to different elements without repeating the styles.

Here's how you do it:

```css
selector1, selector2, selector3 {
    /* style declarations */
}
```

The comma (`,`) is used to combine selectors. The styles you define will apply to all the selectors in the group.

For example, suppose you have three different types of elements â€“ headings `h1`, paragraphs `p`, and anchor links `a`, and you want all of them to be colored red. Instead of writing three separate rules, you can group them:

```css
h1, p, a {
    color: red;
}
```

In the above example, the color red is applied to all `h1`, `p`, and `a` elements.

Remember that while grouping selectors can make your CSS more concise, it can also make your styles less flexible. If you later decide you want `p` elements to be a different color, you'll need to write a separate rule for that. Always aim for a balance between conciseness and flexibility.
