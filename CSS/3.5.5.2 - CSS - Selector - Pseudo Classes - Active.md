Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of the `:active` pseudo-class.

The `:active` pseudo-class in CSS applies a style to an element when it is being activated by the user. For a button or a link, this means the period of time between when you press the mouse button down and when you release it.

Here's an example. Let's say you have a button in your HTML:

```html
<button class="active-button">Click me!</button>
```

You could use the `:active` pseudo-class to change the background color of the button while it is being clicked:

```css
.active-button {
    background-color: blue; /* original color */
    color: white; /* text color */
    padding: 10px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.active-button:active {
    background-color: red; /* color while being clicked */
}
```

In the above CSS, the button's background color is initially blue. When you click on it, the `:active` pseudo-class gets activated and changes the background color to red for the duration of the click. When you release the mouse button, the button reverts to its original state.
