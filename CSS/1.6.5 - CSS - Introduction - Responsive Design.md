Responsive design is a crucial aspect of modern web development. It ensures that your website looks and functions well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Here are some strategies and techniques you can use to create a responsive design using CSS:

**1. Viewport Meta Tag:**
This is typically placed within the `<head>` of your HTML document and it ensures that your page scales correctly on any device.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

**2. Media Queries:**
Media queries are a key tool in responsive design. They allow you to apply CSS rules only when certain conditions are met, such as browser window width.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```
In this example, the background color of the body will change to light blue when the viewport width is 600px or less.

**3. Flexbox:**
Flexbox is a layout module in CSS that makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.item {
  flex: 1 0 200px;
}
```
In this example, `.item` elements will try to have a width of 200px, but they will shrink to fit more items in a row if necessary, and grow to fill the row if there's extra space. And thanks to `flex-wrap`, items will wrap to a new line if there's not enough space in a single line.

**4. CSS Grid:**
CSS Grid is another powerful tool for creating complex responsive layouts. It lets you define a flexible grid of columns and rows, and you can place items where you want within this grid.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```
In this example, grid columns will be created that are a minimum of 200px wide, but they'll stretch to be larger if there's extra space. The `auto-fill` keyword means that as many columns as possible will be created to fill the space.

**5. Relative Units:**
Use relative units like `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`, rather than fixed units like `px`, for sizing elements. This ensures your elements scale appropriately based on the screen size or font size.

```css
section {
  padding: 2em;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

**6. Images:**
Ensure images can scale and aren't larger than their container with max-width:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

**7. Using CSS Frameworks:**
CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Tailwind CSS provide built-in classes and grid systems to make creating responsive designs easier.

In summary, responsive design involves a combination of flexible grids (using percentages for widths rather than fixed pixels), flexible images/media, and CSS media queries to adapt your layout to different screen sizes. It's all about ensuring your website can adapt to the device and screen size of your users. If you want to learn more about any specific topic, let me know!
