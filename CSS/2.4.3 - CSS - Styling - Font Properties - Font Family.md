The `font-family` property in CSS is used to specify the typeface that will be used for the text inside a certain element. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the aesthetics and readability of your website. 

You can specify multiple font families as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers and operating systems. If the first font is not available, the browser will try to use the next font in the list. If none of the fonts are installed on the user's system, it will default to the browser's standard font.

Here is the syntax:

```css
p {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

In the above example, `"Times New Roman"` is the first choice. If it's not available, the browser will try `Times`, and if that's not available, it will use the default `serif` font.

There are two types of font family names:

1. **family-name:** The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.
2. **generic-family:** The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".

The following are the generic families that can be used if none of the named fonts are available:
- `serif` fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters (Times New Roman is the most common serif font).
- `sans-serif` fonts have clean lines (no small lines attached). Arial and Helvetica are the most common sans-serif fonts.
- `monospace` fonts are fonts where every character takes up the same width.
- `cursive` fonts mimic human handwriting.
- `fantasy` fonts are primarily decorative fonts that contain playful representations of characters.

In an ideal world, you'd always be able to use the font you want, but you can't always rely on a font being available, so it's always a good idea to have at least one generic font family included in your `font-family` list.

It's also important to note that if the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: `"Times New Roman"`.
