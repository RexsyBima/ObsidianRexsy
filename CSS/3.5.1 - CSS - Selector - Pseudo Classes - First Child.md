Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of the `:first-child` pseudo-class.

The `:first-child` pseudo-class in CSS matches an element that is the first child element of its parent. 

Here's a basic example:

Suppose you have an unordered list in your HTML:

```html
<ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
</ul>
```

You could use the `:first-child` pseudo-class to change the style of the first list item. Here's how you would do that in your CSS:

```css
ul li:first-child {
    color: red; 
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

In the above CSS, the `:first-child` pseudo-class is used to select the first child of the `ul` element, which is the first `li` element. This first `li` element is then styled to have red and bold text. The other list items (2 and 3) remain unaffected by this rule, as they are not the first child.
