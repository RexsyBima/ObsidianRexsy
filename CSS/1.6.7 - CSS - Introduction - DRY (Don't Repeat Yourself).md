Great question! DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a fundamental principle in programming that encourages the reduction of repetition within your code. Following the DRY principle makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more efficient. Here are some strategies to implement the DRY principle in your CSS:

**1. Use CSS Variables (Custom Properties):**
CSS Variables let you store specific values for reuse throughout your stylesheet. This is especially useful for values that you use frequently, such as primary colors, padding, or font sizes.

```css
:root {
  --main-color: #ff6347;
  --padding: 10px;
}

.container {
  padding: var(--padding);
  background-color: var(--main-color);
}
```

**2. Use Shorthand Properties:**
CSS has many shorthand properties that allow you to specify the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously. For example, instead of defining `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left` individually, you can define them all in one line:

```css
.container {
  padding: 10px 15px 20px 25px; /* Top Right Bottom Left */
}
```

**3. Use Class Selectors Effectively:**
You can use class selectors to apply the same style rules to multiple elements. This can be more efficient than duplicating the same rules for different selectors.

```css
.my-style {
  font-size: 18px;
  color: blue;
}
```

**4. Leverage Inheritance and Cascading:**
Many CSS properties are inherited from parent elements, and you can take advantage of this to reduce redundancy in your code. Remember the 'C' in CSS stands for Cascading; styles defined on parent elements cascade down to their children.

```css
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: black;
}
```
In this example, all child elements of `body` that don't have `font-size` and `color` explicitly set will inherit these properties.

**5. Use CSS Preprocessors:**
CSS Preprocessors like Sass or Less have features like variables, mixins, and functions that allow you to write more DRY and maintainable stylesheets.

For example, in Sass, you can create a mixin for a set of styles that you find yourself using repeatedly:

```scss
@mixin flex-center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.container {
  @include flex-center;
}
```

**6. Use CSS Resets or Normalize.css:**
By using a CSS reset or Normalize.css, you can start with a clean slate and avoid unnecessary repetition of certain styles.

**7. Grouping Selectors:**
If multiple selectors share the same declarations, they can be grouped into a comma-separated list:

```css
h1, h2, h3, .my-class {
  color: green;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```

Remember, while DRY is a helpful principle, don't let it make your code harder to understand or more complex. Sometimes a little repetition in CSS can actually enhance readability. The key is to find the right balance for your project.
