The `em` unit in CSS is a relative unit of measurement, which means it calculates its value based on the font size of its parent element.

The term `em` originally comes from typography, where it referred to the width of the capital letter M in the typeface being used. In digital terms, when we use `em` in CSS, it's relative to the font-size of the nearest parent element.

Let's take an example:

```html
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 1em;">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

Here, the `p` tag is a child of the `div` tag. The `div` tag has a font size of `20px`, and the `p` tag has a font size of `1em`. Because `1em` is equivalent to the computed font size of the parent element, the `p` tag will also have a font size of `20px`.

If you change the `em` value, it will scale relative to the parent's font size. For example, if you were to make the `p` tag's font-size `2em`, it would be twice the parent's font size, or `40px` in this case.

This also works nested, meaning if a child element with a font size set in `em` is inside another child with a font size in `em`, it calculates based on its immediate parent.

```html
<div style="font-size: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">This is some text.
    <span style="font-size: 0.5em;">This is some smaller text.</span>
  </p>
</div>
```

Here, the `p` tag's font size is `30px` (because `1.5em` of `20px` is `30px`), and the `span` tag's font size is `15px` (because `0.5em` of `30px` is `15px`).

Using `em` for font sizes can be very useful for creating scalable and accessible designs, as it allows for easy resizing of fonts based on user preferences or device settings.
