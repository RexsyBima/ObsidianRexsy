Absolutely! In CSS, the asterisk `*` is known as the universal selector. It matches any element in the document. This can be really useful when you want to apply a style to every single element on your page.

For example:

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

This piece of CSS will remove the default margin and padding from every single element on the page. This is a common technique used in many CSS resets to ensure a consistent starting point across all browsers.

The `*` can also be combined with other selectors. Here are a few examples:

```css
/* All direct child elements of the body */
body > * {
    margin-bottom: 1.5em;
}

/* All elements inside paragraphs */
p * {
    color: blue;
}
```

While the universal selector is incredibly powerful and useful, it's worth noting that it should be used sparingly. It can add a lot of weight to the browser's rendering work, which can lead to performance issues. It can also lead to unintended side effects if you're not careful, because it really does apply styles to every element.

One common usage of the universal selector is to ensure every element box-sizing is set to border-box:

```css
*, *::before, *::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This piece of CSS applies `box-sizing: border-box;` to every element and their pseudo-elements, which can make your layouts more predictable and manageable.

Remember, the `*` selector has the lowest specificity, so any other declared style for an element will override it.
