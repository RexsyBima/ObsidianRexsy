To connect a CSS file to an HTML file, you use the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. 

Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `styles.css` is the CSS file that contains your styles. The `href` attribute in the `<link>` tag is used to specify the path to the CSS file.

- `rel="stylesheet"` specifies that the linked file is a stylesheet.
- `type="text/css"` specifies the MIME type of the CSS file.

The `href` attribute can be a full URL or a path relative to the HTML file. If your CSS file is in the same directory as your HTML file, you just need to provide the filename as in the example above. If it's in a different directory, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly, such as `href="css/styles.css"`.

This way of adding CSS is known as "external CSS" and it is the most common and recommended way to apply CSS as it promotes reusability and separation of concerns (i.e., keeping the structure/content (HTML) separate from presentation (CSS)).
