Building layouts in CSS is a broad and complex topic that involves many techniques and tools. Here are some key aspects and concepts to understand:

**1. Box Model:**
In CSS, everything is considered a box. The box model describes how padding, borders, and margins work together to create a box around your content.

**2. Display Property:**
The `display` property determines how an element behaves in the flow of the document. There are many values, but the most common are `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, and `grid`.

**3. Positioning:**
Positioning can control the layout by specifying how elements are positioned. There are four main types of positioning: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`.

**4. Floats and Clear:**
Floats allow elements to be positioned to the left or right, with text flowing around them. Clearing is used to prevent elements from wrapping around floated elements.

**5. Flexbox:**
Flexbox (Flexible Box) is a layout model that allows easy control over alignment, direction, order, and size of boxes within a container. It's particularly good for creating complex alignments and distributing space along a single column or row.

**6. CSS Grid:**
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It allows you to layout items in rows as well as columns, and it's perfect for creating complex grids.

**7. Media Queries:**
Media queries allow you to apply different styles for different screen sizes or conditions, making your design responsive.

**8. Responsive Design:**
Responsive design involves designing a site to look good on all devices, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.
