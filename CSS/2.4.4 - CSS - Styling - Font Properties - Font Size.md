The `font-size` property in CSS is used to control the size of fonts. It can accept various units of measurement including pixels (`px`), points (`pt`), percentages (`%`), ems (`em`), rems (`rem`), and viewport units (`vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`).

The `em` unit is particularly interesting as it's a scalable unit. One `em` is equal to the current `font-size` of the element or the `font-size` of its parent. This means that if you set the `font-size` of an element to be `2em`, it would be twice the size of the current font size.

Here's an example:

```html
<body style="font-size: 16px;">
  <p style="font-size: 1em;">This text is 16px.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 2em;">This text is 32px.</p>
</body>
```

In this example, the font size of the body is set to `16px`. The first paragraph has a font size of `1em`, which equates to the `font-size` of the body, `16px`. The second paragraph has a font size of `2em`, which is twice the `font-size` of the body, `32px`.

It's also worth noting that the `em` unit is not only applicable to `font-size` but can also be used to set the value of other properties like `padding`, `margin`, `width`, `height`, and more.

Using `em` for font sizes can be very useful for creating scalable and accessible designs, as it allows for easy resizing of fonts based on user preferences or device settings. For example, users can adjust their browser settings to increase the default font size if they find it hard to read small text. If you've used `em` units for your font sizes, your text will scale automatically to respect the user's preferences.

However, the cascading nature of `em` can sometimes make it difficult to manage, especially in a complex layout. If you want to use scalable units but avoid the cascading nature of `em`, you might consider using `rem` instead, which stands for "root em". This is similar to `em`, but it always refers to the font size of the root element (`<html>`), not the parent element.

The `font-size` CSS property sets the size of the font. Changing the font size also updates the sizes of the em, ex, ch, rem and other relative length units.

Here's the syntax:

```css
element {
    font-size: value;
}
```

The value could be in absolute or relative units.

Absolute size:

- `px` (pixels): Absolute units, fixed and do not scale with the size of the viewport or parent element.
- `pt` (points): Mostly used in print media, 1pt = 1/72 inch.

Relative size:

- `em`: The size is relative to the parent element's font size. If the parent has a font-size of 20px, 1em = 20px for that element. If there's no parent element, `em` units will default to the browser's default font size, typically 16px.
- `rem`: Similar to `em`, but always relative to the root or `<html>` element's font size.
- `%`: The size is relative to the parent element's font size.
- `vw`: Viewport width. The size is relative to the viewport width. 1vw = 1% of viewport width.
- `vh`: Viewport height. The size is relative to the viewport height. 1vh = 1% of viewport height.

Example:

```css
p {
    font-size: 20px; /* font size of 20 pixels */
}

p {
    font-size: 2em; /* font size of 2 times the parent element's font size */
}

p {
    font-size: 150%; /* font size 1.5 times the parent's */
}

p {
    font-size: 3vw; /* font size of 3% of the viewport's width */
}
```

It's generally best to use relative units like em, rem, %, vw/vh, as they allow for more responsive design that can adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences.

Remember that `font-size` is inherited from parent to child elements. If a parent element has a `font-size` of 20px, all of its child elements will inherit that font size, unless they have a `font-size` specified.
