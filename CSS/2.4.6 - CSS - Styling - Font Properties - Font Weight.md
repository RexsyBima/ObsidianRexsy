The `font-weight` property in CSS is used to specify the weight or thickness of a font. The `font-weight` property accepts either keyword values or numeric values ranging from 100 to 900. 

Here's the basic syntax:

```css
element {
  font-weight: value;
}
```

The possible values are:

- `normal`: This is the default value, equivalent to `400`.
- `bold`: This creates bold text, equivalent to `700`.
- `bolder`: This creates text that is bolder than the parent element.
- `lighter`: This creates text that is lighter than the parent element.
- `100` to `900`: These are numerical representations of font weights, with `100` being the thinnest and `900` being the thickest. Not all font families have all these weights, in many fonts `400` is the same as `normal` and `700` is the same as `bold`.

Here's an example:

```css
p.normal {
  font-weight: normal;
}

p.bold {
  font-weight: bold;
}

p.bolder {
  font-weight: bolder;
}

p.light {
  font-weight: 100;
}

p.heavy {
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

In the example above, the paragraph with the class `.normal` will have a normal font weight, the `.bold` class will have a bold font weight, `.bolder` will have a font weight that is bolder than its parent element's font weight, `.light` will have a light font weight (`100`), and `.heavy` will have a heavy font weight (`900`).

It's important to note that not all font families support all font weights. Some font families may only provide `normal` and `bold` options. If a certain `font-weight` is specified but not available for a given font family, the browser will default to the nearest available weight.
