CSS variables are a very powerful feature that allows you to define specific values to be reused throughout your document.

CSS variables are defined with two dashes and are typically declared inside a selector like `:root` or `body` (or any other selector) and can be used in your stylesheet with the `var()` function.

Here's an example:

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: coral;
  --main-txt-color: #ffffff;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
  color: var(--main-txt-color);
}
```

In the example above, `--main-bg-color` and `--main-txt-color` are CSS variables. The `:root` is a pseudo-class that selects the root element of the document, in the case of HTML, it's the `<html>` tag. It's commonly used with CSS variables so that they are available globally (to the whole document).

Using CSS variables can be beneficial for many reasons:

1. **Maintainability**: If you want to change a value everywhere itâ€™s used, you just have to change it in one place.
2. **Readability**: They can make your code easier to read and understand.
3. **Flexibility**: They can even be updated in real-time through JavaScript, paving the way for dynamic theme changes and much more.

Remember, CSS variables are case-sensitive (`--mainColor` and `--maincolor` would be considered different variables), and they can be scoped to a specific element (and its children), or be global (by declaring them on the `:root` or `body` selector).

It's worth noting, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, CSS variables are supported in all modern browsers, but not in Internet Explorer. If you need to support older browsers, you'll need to use a fallback or consider whether using CSS variables is right for your project.
