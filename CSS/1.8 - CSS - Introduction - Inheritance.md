In CSS, inheritance is a key feature where some property values set on parent elements are propagated to their children. In other words, some styles are automatically passed from parent elements to their descendants.

For example, if you set the `color` and `font-family` property of an element to `blue` and `Arial`, respectively, these properties are inherited by the descendants of that element. That means, unless specified otherwise, all child elements will also have a text color of `blue` and the font type of `Arial`.

Here's an example:

```html
<div style="color: blue; font-family: Arial;">
    This is some text.
    <p>The paragraph inherits styles.</p>
</div>
```

In this case, the `p` element will inherit the `color` and `font-family` from the parent `div`.

However, it's crucial to know that not all CSS properties are inherited. For instance, properties like `border`, `padding`, `margin`, and `background` are not inherited. If you want a child element to inherit a certain property, you can use the `inherit` value.

Example:

```html
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">
    <p style="border: inherit;">This paragraph has a border.</p>
</div>
```

Here, the `p` element will inherit the `border` property from its parent `div`.

In summary, the concept of inheritance in CSS allows certain styles to naturally cascade down a document tree from parent elements to their descendants, which promotes code efficiency and consistency across a website.
