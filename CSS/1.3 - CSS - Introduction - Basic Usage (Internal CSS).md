Let's say we have an HTML file with a header, a paragraph, and a list:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

To style this HTML using CSS, we can include a `<style>` element within the `<head>` of the HTML file (this is called "internal CSS"):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }

        h1 {
            color: navy;
            text-align: center;
        }

        p {
            font-size: 20px;
        }

        ul {
            list-style-type: circle;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above example:

- The `body` selector styles the whole body of the document. It sets a light blue background color and changes the font to Arial.
- The `h1` selector styles the heading. It changes the text color to navy and centers the text.
- The `p` selector styles the paragraph. It changes the font size to 20 pixels.
- The `ul` selector styles the unordered list. It changes the bullet points to circles instead of the default discs.

While this example shows the basic usage of CSS in an HTML file, remember that for larger projects, it's often best to use external CSS files to keep your styles separate from your HTML for better organization and maintainability. This is done by linking to the external CSS file in the `<head>` of your HTML document.
