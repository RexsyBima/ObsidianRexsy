Sure, the `:focus` pseudo-class in CSS is used to add styles to an element when it has focus. This is typically used on form elements such as `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

For example, let's say you want to change the border and background color of an input field when it's in focus. Here's how you could do it:

HTML:
```html
<input type="text" class="my-input" placeholder="Focus on me">
```

CSS:
```css
.my-input {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.my-input:focus {
    outline: none;
    border-color: #4A90E2;
    background-color: #EAF6FD;
}
```

In the above CSS, when the input field with class `my-input` receives focus (for example, by clicking on it or using the Tab key), the `:focus` pseudo-class gets activated. It removes the default browser outline, changes the border color to a shade of blue (`#4A90E2`), and changes the background color to a lighter shade of blue (`#EAF6FD`). When the input field loses focus, it reverts back to the original styles.

This is a common practice to help users identify which form field they're currently interacting with.
