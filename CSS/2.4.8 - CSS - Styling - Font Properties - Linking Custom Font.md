To use a custom font in your CSS, you first need to host the font file on your server and then use the `@font-face` rule in your CSS to link to the font file. Here's how you do it:

1. **Upload the font files to your server.** The font files are usually in formats like `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, or `.eot`. The Web Open Font Format (WOFF & WOFF2) is the most efficient format for web use.

2. **Use the `@font-face` rule in your CSS to link to the font file.**

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont';
  src: url('path-to-font/my-custom-font.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('path-to-font/my-custom-font.woff') format('woff');
}
```
The `font-family` property inside the `@font-face` rule specifies a name for the font. The `src` property specifies the path to the font file. The `format` part is optional but recommended, it helps the browser to find the font faster.

3. **Use the custom font in your CSS.**

```css
body {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont', Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
In this CSS rule, the `font-family` property is using the name specified in the `@font-face` rule. If the custom font cannot be loaded for any reason, the browser will fall back to Arial and then to any sans-serif font.

Remember, it's always a good idea to specify fallback fonts, in case your custom font cannot be loaded or is not supported by a user's browser or device. And also, ensure you have the necessary permissions to use and host the custom font on your server.
