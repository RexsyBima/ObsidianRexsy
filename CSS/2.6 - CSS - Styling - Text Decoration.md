The `text-decoration` property in CSS is used to decorate the text content of an element. This can be useful for indicating links, marking deleted text, underlining, overlining, or striking through text. 

Here are the main values that `text-decoration` can have:

1. **none:** This value removes any text decoration. It's useful for removing underlines from links, for example.

2. **underline:** This value adds a line under the text.

3. **overline:** This value adds a line over the text.

4. **line-through:** This value adds a line through the middle of the text. This is often used to indicate text that should be considered deleted or irrelevant.

5. **blink:** This value makes the text blink, but it's widely considered annoying and bad practice for accessibility, and is ignored by most modern browsers.

The `text-decoration` property is a shorthand for `text-decoration-line`, `text-decoration-color`, and `text-decoration-style`. Here's how you could use these properties individually:

```css
p {
    text-decoration-line: underline;
    text-decoration-color: red;
    text-decoration-style: wavy;
}
```

This will create a wavy red underline beneath the text in the paragraph elements. 

You can use the `text-decoration` shorthand to apply all of these in one line:

```css
p {
    text-decoration: wavy underline red;
}
```

These are just the basics, and there's a lot more to learn about styling text in CSS. But with the `text-decoration` property, you should be able to add some simple, yet effective, styles to your text.
