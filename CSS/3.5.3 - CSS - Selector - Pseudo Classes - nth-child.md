Sure, I'd be happy to provide an example of the `:nth-child` pseudo-class.

The `:nth-child` pseudo-class matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings. It uses a function-like syntax to specify a formula (or keyword) to select every nth element.

Let's start with an example where we have an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
    <li>List Item 1</li>
    <li>List Item 2</li>
    <li>List Item 3</li>
    <li>List Item 4</li>
    <li>List Item 5</li>
</ul>
```

If you wanted to style only the third list item, you could use the `:nth-child` pseudo-class like this:

```css
li:nth-child(3) {
    color: red;
}
```

This would make the text of the third list item red.

`nth-child` can also take keywords 'odd' and 'even', so you could style every other list item differently like this:

```css
li:nth-child(odd) {
    color: blue;
}

li:nth-child(even) {
    color: green;
}
```

This would make odd list items blue and even ones green.

Another powerful feature is that `:nth-child` can take a formula like `an+b` where `a` and `b` are constants. This allows for some complex selections. For example, `:nth-child(3n+1)` would select every third element starting from the first one.
