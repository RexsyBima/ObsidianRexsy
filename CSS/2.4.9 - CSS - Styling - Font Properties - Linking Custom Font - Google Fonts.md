Using Google Fonts in your project is relatively straightforward and involves a few simple steps:

1. **Find the font you want to use.** Go to the Google Fonts website (https://fonts.google.com/), browse the font library, and select the font you want to use.

2. **Select the font style.** Once you've chosen a font, you can select the specific styles you want to use (for example, regular, bold, italic, etc.). Click on the "Select this style" button next to each style you want to use.

3. **Get the link to the selected font.** After you've chosen the font styles, click on the "Embed" tab in the panel that pops up on the right side of the screen. You'll see an `<link>` element that you need to add to your HTML document. It should look something like this:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
In the above link, "Roboto" is the font name, and "wght@400;700" indicates that the normal (400) and bold (700) weights are being loaded. 

4. **Add the link to your HTML.** Paste the `<link>` tag into the `<head>` of your HTML document. 

5. **Use the font in your CSS.** Now you can use the font in your CSS file, just like any other font. Here's an example:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```
In this example, 'Roboto' is the font-family, and 'sans-serif' is the fallback font in case 'Roboto' fails to load for some reason.

And that's it! Your custom Google Font is now linked to your project and ready to be used in your CSS.
