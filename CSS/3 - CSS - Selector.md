Sure, in CSS there are various ways to select a single element or subset of elements. Here are the most common ways to do it:

1. **Element Selector**: This is the most basic way to select elements. It will select all instances of a particular HTML element on your page. For instance, `p { color: blue; }` will apply the style to all paragraph elements on your page.

2. **Class Selector**: If you want to style a subset of elements, or a single element, one common way is to use a class. A class can be added to any HTML element using the `class` attribute. In your CSS, you can select elements with a certain class by prefixing the class name with a period (`.`). For instance, `.my-class { color: blue; }` will apply the style to all elements with the class "my-class". **This is what mostly will be used rather than ID selector**

3. **ID Selector**: If you want to style a single, unique element, you can use an ID. An ID can be added to any HTML element using the `id` attribute. In your CSS, you can select an element by its ID by prefixing the ID with a hash (`#`) symbol. For example, `#my-id { color: blue; }` will apply the style to the element with the ID "my-id".

4. **Attribute Selector**: You can also select elements based on their attributes. For example, `input[type="text"] { color: blue; }` will select all input elements where the type attribute is "text".

5. **Pseudo-class Selector**: Pseudo-classes allow you to style elements in certain states or certain positions. For instance, `a:hover { color: blue; }` will apply the style to links when they are being hovered over. 

6. **Pseudo-element Selector**: Pseudo-elements allow you to style certain parts of an element. For example, `p::first-letter { color: blue; }` will apply the style to the first letter of every paragraph.

7. **Combinators and Multiple Selectors**: You can select a subset of elements by combining different selectors. For instance, `div p { color: blue; }` will select all paragraphs that are inside divs. You can also use the comma to apply a style to multiple different selectors at once. For instance, `div, p { color: blue; }` will apply the style to both divs and paragraphs.

Remember, when you're using these selectors, the styles will cascade down to child elements unless you specify otherwise. For instance, if you set `color: blue;` on a div, all text inside that div will be blue unless you have a more specific rule that applies a different color. This is known as inheritance in CSS.
