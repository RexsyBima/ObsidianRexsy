Choosing the right fonts for a website involves considering multiple factors including readability, loading speed, and compatibility across different systems or browsers.

In HTML and CSS, you specify fonts using the `font-family` property. However, not every font is installed on every device or available in all browsers. For example, a font installed on a Windows device might not be available on an Apple device, or vice versa.

For this reason, you typically provide a list of fonts, ordered by preference, as the value for the `font-family` property. This is known as a "font stack". The browser will go through the list and pick the first font that is available on the user's system. 

Here's an example of a font stack:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

In this example, the browser will first try to use "Arial". If "Arial" is not available, it will try to use "Helvetica". If neither "Arial" nor "Helvetica" are available, it will default to any available sans-serif font.

To ensure that text is displayed, the last font in the stack should be a generic font family, which is a group of fonts that share a basic look. There are five generic families: `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, `cursive`, and `fantasy`.

Apart from system fonts, web fonts can be used. Web fonts are downloaded by the browser while rendering the webpage and are an important part of modern web design. Google Fonts is a popular source of free web fonts.

One caveat with web fonts is that they can impact page load time. So, you should balance the need for unique typography with performance considerations.

Another solution is to embed fonts in your CSS using the `@font-face` rule, which allows you to specify a path to a font file to be loaded whenever that font is used. This is a more advanced technique and requires careful handling to ensure compatibility and performance.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont';
  src:  url('myfont.woff2') format('woff2'),
        url('myfont.woff') format('woff');
}

body {
  font-family: 'MyWebFont', Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

In this case, the browser will first try to use the "MyWebFont" web font. If it cannot render that font, it will try "Arial", and then finally any sans-serif font.

In conclusion, understanding and choosing fonts for a webpage can be a complex process that balances design, compatibility, and performance.
