Sure, the `:visited` pseudo-class in CSS allows you to apply styles to links that have been visited (clicked on) by the user.

Here's an example. Let's say we have two links in our HTML:

```html
<a href="https://example1.com" class="my-link">Example 1</a>
<a href="https://example2.com" class="my-link">Example 2</a>
```

You can use the `:visited` pseudo-class to change the color of the links after they have been visited:

```css
.my-link:visited {
    color: purple;
}
```

In this case, after a user clicks on one of the links and then returns to your page, the link they visited will be displayed in purple, while the link they haven't clicked on yet will retain its original color.

Please note, for privacy reasons, there are restrictions on what styles you can apply with `:visited`. For example, you can change the color of text and the content of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, but you cannot change styles that would reveal whether a link leads to a previously visited URL, like background image or size properties.
