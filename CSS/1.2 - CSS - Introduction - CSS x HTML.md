The most common and best practice is to create a separate CSS file and then link it to your HTML file. This method is known as external CSS. It allows for cleaner and more maintainable code, as it separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS).

To link an external CSS file, you'd use the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

In this case, `styles.css` is your CSS file, which should be in the same directory as your HTML file. If your CSS file is in a different directory, you'd need to adjust the `href` accordingly.

Now, regarding what CSS can do to an HTML file, the possibilities are extensive! Here are a few key highlights:

**1. Styling and Layouts**: CSS is most commonly used to style HTML elements. You can adjust colors, fonts, borders, backgrounds, etc. Moreover, CSS can be used to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. You can create complex layouts using properties for margin, padding, display, grid or flexbox, and more.

**2. Responsiveness**: CSS is crucial in creating responsive designs. With media queries, you can apply different styles for different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.). This ensures that your website looks good on all screen sizes.

**3. Animations**: You can create animations using CSS. These animations can occur as a reaction to user actions like hover, click, or focus, or they can run on their own using keyframes.

**4. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: CSS introduces concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, which allow you to style specific parts of an element or add special effects.

**5. Transforms and Transitions**: CSS allows for transformation effects like rotate, skew, scale, etc., and transitions that smoothly change from one style to another upon user interaction.

**6. Variables**: Modern CSS now supports variables, which can make your code more efficient and easier to manage.

So, in short, CSS breathes life into an HTML document, making it visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive. It's like the paint and decoration for your house, turning the basic structure into something aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to live in.
