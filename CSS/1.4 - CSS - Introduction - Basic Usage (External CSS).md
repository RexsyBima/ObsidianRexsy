Using an external CSS file is a great way to organize your styles for larger projects, as it separates your styles from your HTML content. It also allows you to reuse the same styles across multiple pages, making your stylesheets more maintainable and your site more consistent.

Here's an example of how you might use an external CSS file:

1. First, create your CSS file. You might name it `styles.css`, for example. In this file, you might define some styles like this:

```css
/* styles.css */

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: circle;
}
```

2. Then, in your HTML file, you would link to the CSS file using a `<link>` element in the `<head>` of your HTML document. It would look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, `href="styles.css"` is the path to your CSS file. If the CSS file is in the same directory as your HTML file, you can just use the filename. If it's in a different directory, you'd need to include the path to the file, such as `href="css/styles.css"`.

This will apply the styles defined in the `styles.css` file to your HTML document. It's a neat and organized way of applying CSS, and it's especially useful when you have a lot of styles or want to use the same styles across multiple HTML files.
