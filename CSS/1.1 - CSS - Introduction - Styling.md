Styling in CSS involves applying aesthetic attributes to HTML elements. This can include things like colors, fonts, layout designs, animations, and more.

Let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have an HTML document with a paragraph element:

```html
<p id="greeting">Hello, World!</p>
```

You can style this paragraph in CSS by selecting the element and defining properties for it:

```css
#greeting {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

In this example:

- `#greeting` is a CSS selector that selects the HTML element with the id "greeting".
- `color`, `font-size`, and `font-family` are CSS properties.
- `blue`, `20px`, and `Arial, sans-serif` are the corresponding values of these properties.

The result of the above CSS is that the text "Hello, World!" will be displayed in blue, in a 20px font size, and in the Arial font (if it's not available, the browser will use any sans-serif font).

There are three main ways to apply CSS to an HTML document:

1. **Inline CSS**: This involves adding the style attribute directly to the HTML tag. 

    Example:
    ```html
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;">Hello, World!</p>
    ```
   
2. **Internal CSS**: This is done by including the CSS inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. 

    Example:
    ```html
    <head>
      <style>
        p {
          color: blue;
          font-size: 20px;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    ```
   
3. **External CSS**: This is the most common and recommended way, where the CSS is written in a separate file with the .css extension and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. 

    Example:
    ```html
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```
    And in the styles.css file:
    ```css
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```

Each method has its use cases, but in general, it's considered best practice to use external CSS as it separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

Remember that the styling power of CSS extends beyond colors and fonts. You can create responsive layouts, animations, transformations, and much more. The more you explore, the more you'll be able to create with CSS.
