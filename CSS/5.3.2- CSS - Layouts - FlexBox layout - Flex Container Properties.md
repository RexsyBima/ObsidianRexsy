A flex container in CSS is an element that has `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` applied to it. When you apply one of these properties, it makes the element a flex container and its children become flex items. Flex containers have several properties that can be used to control the layout of its children:

1. `flex-direction`: This property determines the direction of the main axis. This can take four values: `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* default value, items are laid out left to right */
}
```

2. `flex-wrap`: This property determines whether flex items are forced into a single line or can be wrapped onto multiple lines. This can take three values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* items will wrap onto multiple lines if needed */
}
```

3. `flex-flow`: This is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap; /* flex-direction is row and flex-wrap is wrap */
}
```

4. `justify-content`: This property aligns flex items along the main axis of the current line. This can take five values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line */
}
```

5. `align-items`: This property defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. This can take five values: `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center; /* items are centered in the cross-axis */
}
```

6. `align-content`: This property aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis. This can take six values: `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-between; /* lines are evenly distributed; first line is at the start of the container, last one at the end */
}
```

Remember that these properties are used for the flex container and affect the layout of the flex items within.
