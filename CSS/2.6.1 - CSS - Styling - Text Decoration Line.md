The `text-decoration-line` CSS property sets the kind of decoration that is used on the text of an element. The syntax looks like this:

```css
text-decoration-line: none|underline|overline|line-through|blink;
```

Here are the possible values for the `text-decoration-line` property:

1. **none:** Produces no text decoration. This is the default value, meaning that if you do not specify a `text-decoration-line` value, none will be applied.

2. **underline:** This value adds a line under the text.

3. **overline:** This value adds a line over the text.

4. **line-through:** This value adds a line through the middle of the text. This is often used to indicate text that should be considered deleted or irrelevant.

5. **blink:** This value makes the text blink. However, please note that this is generally considered bad practice as it can be distracting and can lead to accessibility issues. It is also not supported in most modern browsers.

You can also specify multiple values, for instance:

```css
p {
    text-decoration-line: underline overline;
}
```

This CSS would apply both an underline and an overline to the text in paragraph (`<p>`) elements. Note that multiple values should be separated by spaces.
