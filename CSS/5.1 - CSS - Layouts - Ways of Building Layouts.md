There are 3 ways of Building Layouts in CSS :

Building layouts in CSS involves various techniques, including using float, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. Let's dive in deeper:

**1. Float Layouts:**
The `float` property is used for wrapping text around images typically, but it can also be used to create entire layouts.

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

.left {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}

.right {
  float: right;
  width: 50%;
}
```

In this example, the `.left` class will float to the left side of `.container`, and the `.right` class will float to the right side, creating a two-column layout. However, you must clear your floats to prevent layout issues. One way is to use a clearfix:

```css
.container::after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```

**2. Flexbox:**
Flexbox is a more robust way to create layouts, especially for aligning items vertically or horizontally. It's great for creating components or smaller-scale layouts.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.item {
  flex: 1;  /* This means that each flex item will take up an equal amount of space within the .container */
}
```

This example would create a row of equal-width items.

**3. CSS Grid:**
CSS Grid is powerful and designed for creating two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns at the same time).

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

In this example, `.container` becomes a grid container, and every direct child of `.container` becomes a grid item. These items will be arranged into three equal-width columns.

It's important to note that these methods can be used together. For instance, you might use CSS Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for components inside grid items. Remember, each method has its strengths and suitable use cases. For mastering these techniques, it's highly recommended to experiment by creating your layouts and adjusting different properties. Websites like CSS-Tricks, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network), and freeCodeCamp have interactive lessons and guides on these topics.
