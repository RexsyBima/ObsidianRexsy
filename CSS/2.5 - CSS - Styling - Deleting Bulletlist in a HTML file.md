To remove bullet points from a list in HTML, you use the CSS `list-style-type` property and set its value to `none`.

Here's an example. Let's say you have an unordered list like so:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

You can remove the bullet points by targeting the `ul` element in your CSS and setting `list-style-type` to `none`:

```css
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}
```

This will result in a list with no bullet points.

Just remember that removing the bullet points may make it harder for users to recognize your list as a list, so consider using other styles or indentations to help differentiate list items from the rest of your content.
