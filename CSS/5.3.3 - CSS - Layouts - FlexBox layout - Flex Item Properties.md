In a flex container, its children are called flex items. They also have several properties that control their behavior within the flex container:

1. `order`: This property controls the order in which items appear in the flex container. Flex items are laid out in the source order by default, but this can be changed with `order`.

```css
.item {
  order: 2; /* this item will now appear second, even if it's not the second child in the source */
}
```

2. `flex-grow`: This property specifies how much of the remaining space in the flex container should be assigned to the item. 

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 1; /* this item will grow to take up any remaining space, if all items have flex-grow set to 1, they will share the space equally */
}
```

3. `flex-shrink`: This property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the items in the flex container.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 2; /* this item will shrink twice as much as other items when there isn't enough space */
}
```

4. `flex-basis`: This property specifies the initial main size of the flex item, before free space is distributed according to the flex factors.

```css
.item {
  flex-basis: 200px; /* this item will start out at 200px wide, then will adjust based on the flex-grow and flex-shrink factors */
}
```

5. `flex`: This is a shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` combined. The second and third parameters (`flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`) are optional. 

```css
.item {
  flex: 1 0 200px; /* this item will grow and shrink at a rate of 1, and has a starting size of 200px */
}
```

6. `align-self`: This property allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

```css
.item {
  align-self: flex-start; /* this item will be flushed to the top of the container, ignoring the align-items property set on the container */
}
```

These properties allow you to create complex layouts with flexible, responsive elements.
