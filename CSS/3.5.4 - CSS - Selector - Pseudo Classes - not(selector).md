Sure, the `:not()` pseudo-class in CSS allows you to select all elements that do not match a certain criteria.

For example, let's say you have a list of items, and one of them has a class `important`. You want to color all items that do not have the `important` class.

In your HTML:

```html
<ul>
    <li class="important">Important item</li>
    <li>Regular item 1</li>
    <li>Regular item 2</li>
    <li>Regular item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In your CSS, you can use the `:not()` pseudo-class:

```css
li:not(.important) {
    color: grey;
}
```

This will color all `li` elements that do not have the `important` class grey. The item with the `important` class will remain unaffected by this rule.

Remember, the `:not()` pseudo-class can only take a simple selector as its argument. A simple selector includes types (like `div`), classes (like `.class-name`), IDs (like `#id-name`), attributes (like `[attr=value]`), or pseudo-classes (like `:hover`). It doesn't accept complex selectors or combinators.
