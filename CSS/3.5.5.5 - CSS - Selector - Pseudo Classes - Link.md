Sure, here's an example of how you might use the various link-related pseudo-classes (`:link`, `:visited`, `:hover`, and `:active`) in CSS. 

Let's say you have a webpage with several links:

```html
<a href="#">Home</a>
<a href="#">About</a>
<a href="#">Contact</a>
```

You can use the following CSS to style these links:

```css
/* This applies to links that have not yet been clicked */
a:link {
    color: blue;
}

/* This applies to links that the user has clicked on */
a:visited {
    color: purple;
}

/* This applies when the user hovers their cursor over a link */
a:hover {
    color: red;
}

/* This applies when a link is being clicked (or otherwise activated) */
a:active {
    color: yellow;
}
```

In this example, unvisited links are blue, visited links are purple, links that the mouse is hovering over are red, and links that are currently being clicked on are yellow. These styles can help make your webpage more interactive and user-friendly. 

It's worth noting that due to privacy concerns, there are some limitations on the styles you can apply to `:visited` links. For example, you can't use it to change an element's dimensions (which would allow a site to detect which pages a user had visited).
