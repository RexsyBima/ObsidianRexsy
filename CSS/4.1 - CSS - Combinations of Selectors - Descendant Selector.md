Sure thing! A descendant selector in CSS is a way to select an element that is nested inside another element. A descendant selector is made up of two or more selectors separated by whitespace.

The syntax looks like this:

```css
parent child { style properties }
```

In this syntax, `parent` is the ancestor element and `child` is any element that is nested inside the `parent`, whether it's a direct child or a child buried more deeply in the HTML structure.

Let's take a look at a more concrete example. Say you have the following HTML:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph within a div element.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a standalone paragraph.</p>
```

If you wanted to apply a style only to the paragraph that's within the `div`, you could use a descendant selector. Here's an example:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
```

This CSS rule applies to any `p` element that is a descendant of a `div` element. So, in the HTML above, the first paragraph ("This is a paragraph within a div element.") would be colored blue, but the second paragraph ("This is a standalone paragraph.") would not be affected.

You can also chain these selectors together. If you had a `span` inside the `p` inside the `div`, you could target it like this:

```css
div p span {
  color: red;
}
```

This would apply to any `span` that's a descendant of a `p` that's a descendant of a `div`. 

Remember, descendant selectors are not just limited to direct children, but select all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

That's the basics of descendant selectors in CSS! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else you'd like to learn.
