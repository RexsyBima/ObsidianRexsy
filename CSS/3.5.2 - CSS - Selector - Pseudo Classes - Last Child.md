Sure! The `:last-child` pseudo-class in CSS matches an element that is the last child of its parent. 

Here is a simple example: Suppose we have an unordered list with several list items. We want to change the color of the last list item to red. 

The HTML for our list could look like this:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>
```

We can use the `:last-child` pseudo-class in our CSS to target the last list item:

```css
li:last-child {
    color: red;
}
```

In this case, the text of "Item 4" will be red because it is the last child of the `ul` parent element. All the other list items will remain their default color (usually black) because they are not the last child. 

Remember that `:last-child` is dependent on the parent element, not the type of the element. So in the above example, if "Item 4" was instead a `p` tag, it would not be targeted by `li:last-child` because it is not a list item, even though it is still the last child of its parent.
