Real-time editing of an HTML file's styles in the browser can be done via the browser's DevTools. The process may vary slightly depending on the browser, but here's the general approach using Google Chrome as an example:

1. **Open DevTools**: Right-click on any part of a web page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element." Alternatively, you can press F12 on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + I on a Mac.

2. **Navigate to the Elements Tab**: The Elements tab gives you access to the HTML and CSS of the page. On the left, you'll see the HTML structure of the page. On the right, you'll see the CSS rules applied to the currently selected element in the HTML structure.

3. **Edit Styles**: Click on any CSS rule on the right side to edit it. You can change values, add new properties, or disable properties by checking/unchecking them. 

4. **Add New Styles**: You can add a new CSS rule by clicking on the + button in the top right corner of the styles tab. This will create a new rule for the currently selected element, and you can add any properties and values you want.

5. **Edit HTML**: You can also edit the HTML of the page in real-time. Just double-click on any element in the HTML structure on the left side and start editing.

Remember that these changes are only temporary - when you refresh the page, your changes will disappear, as they're not saved back to the source files on the server.

For a more permanent solution, you would need to use a live reloading tool or a module bundler with a hot module replacement plugin. Tools like `live-server`, `BrowserSync` or module bundlers like `webpack` are commonly used in development environments to refresh the browser whenever a change in the source files (like your CSS files) is detected. These tools would require some setup in your development environment and are not directly done in the browser.
