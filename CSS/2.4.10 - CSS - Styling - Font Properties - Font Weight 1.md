The `text-transform` property in CSS is used to specify the capitalization of an element's text. This property can be very useful for styling purposes, especially in areas like headers or buttons where you may want text to appear in a certain way.

There are five values that you can use with the `text-transform` property:

1. **none:** This is the default value. It specifies that the text will not be transformed.

2. **capitalize:** This value transforms the first character of each word to uppercase; all other characters remain as they are.

3. **uppercase:** This value transforms all characters to uppercase.

4. **lowercase:** This value transforms all characters to lowercase.

5. **full-width:** This value transforms all characters to full-width, useful for when mixing Latin characters with other scripts such as Japanese.

Here are examples of how to use `text-transform`:

```css
p.none {
    text-transform: none;
}

p.capitalize {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}

p.uppercase {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

p.lowercase {
    text-transform: lowercase;
}

p.fullwidth {
    text-transform: full-width;
}
```

And in HTML:

```html
<p class="none">This is some text.</p>
<p class="capitalize">This is some text.</p>
<p class="uppercase">This is some text.</p>
<p class="lowercase">This is some text.</p>
<p class="fullwidth">This is some text.</p>
```

This will render as:

1. This is some text.
2. This Is Some Text.
3. THIS IS SOME TEXT.
4. this is some text.
5. This Is Some Text. (in full-width characters)

Note: The `text-transform` property won't change the actual value of the text in the HTML source; it only changes the way the text is displayed in the browser.
