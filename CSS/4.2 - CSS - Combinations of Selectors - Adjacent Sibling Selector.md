Certainly! The Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`) is a powerful tool in CSS for selecting an element that is the next sibling to another element.

The syntax is as follows:

```css
element1 + element2 { style properties }
```

In this case, `element1` and `element2` share the same parent. `element2` is the adjacent sibling if it immediately follows `element1`.

Let's consider an example. Say we have the following HTML:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is the third paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

Now, if we want to style only the paragraph that directly follows the first paragraph, we could use the adjacent sibling selector like this:

```css
p + p {
  color: blue;
}
```

This rule applies to any `p` element that directly follows another `p` element. So, in the HTML above, the second paragraph ("This is the second paragraph.") would be colored blue, but the first and third paragraphs would not be affected.

Note that the adjacent sibling selector only selects the sibling element that immediately follows the first element. If there are other sibling elements that also match the second selector but are not immediately following the first selector, they won't be selected.
