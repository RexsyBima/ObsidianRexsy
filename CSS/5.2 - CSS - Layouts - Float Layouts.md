Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and easily done in CSS by giving an element a `float` property.

Here's a simple example of using `float`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  float: right;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed pulvinar massa id dui aliquet aliquam. Phasellus condimentum nibh ut lacus fringilla, et laoreet dolor viverra. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae.</p>

<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example image" width="200" height="200">

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the image is moved to the right side of the parent element, and the text flows around it on the left side.

Float's strengths shine when the width of the float is set in percentages. This allows the floats to adjust to the size of their parent.

Float can be a bit difficult to grasp at first. But essentially, when you float an element, it is taken out of the document's flow and shifted to the left or right of its containing box. Other content within the same containing box then flows around the floated element.

One thing to note is that, by default, floats can overlap other content, to prevent this we can use the `clear` property, which allows you to say "nothing should float to the left or right of this element". Here is an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  float: right;
}

.clear {
  clear: both;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed pulvinar massa id dui aliquet aliquam. Phasellus condimentum nibh ut lacus fringilla, et laoreet dolor viverra. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae.</p>

<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example image" width="200" height="200">

<div class="clear"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `.clear` class is used after the floated image to prevent any elements from floating to the right of the image. 

Remember, while float layouts can be very useful, modern layouts are typically built with Flexbox or CSS Grid, which offer more flexibility and control. But, understanding float is crucial for maintaining older websites that utilize this technique.
