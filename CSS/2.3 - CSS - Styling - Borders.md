Sure, borders are an important aspect of CSS styling. Let's dive into CSS border properties.

1. **border-width**: This property sets the width of the borders. The width can be defined in pixels, ems, or rems. You can define the width for all sides at once or individually for each side (top, right, bottom, and left). For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border-width: 2px; /* all borders have a width of 2 pixels */
    }

    div {
        border-width: 2px 4px 2px 4px; /* top and bottom borders have a width of 2 pixels, right and left have a width of 4 pixels */
    }
    ```

2. **border-color**: This property sets the color of the borders. Similar to `border-width`, you can set a color for all sides at once or individually for each side. For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border-color: red; /* all borders are red */
    }

    div {
        border-color: red green blue yellow; /* top border is red, right border is green, bottom border is blue, left border is yellow */
    }
    ```

3. **border-style**: This property sets the style of the borders. Possible values include `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, `double`, `groove`, `ridge`, `inset`, `outset`, and `none`. For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border-style: solid; /* all borders are solid */
    }

    div {
        border-style: solid dotted dashed double; /* top border is solid, right border is dotted, bottom border is dashed, left border is double */
    }
    ```

4. **border**: This is a shorthand property for `border-width`, `border-color`, and `border-style`. For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border: 2px solid red; /* all borders have a width of 2 pixels, are solid, and red */
    }
    ```

5. **border-top**, **border-right**, **border-bottom**, **border-left**: These properties set the width, style, and color of the top, right, bottom, and left borders, respectively. For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border-top: 2px solid red;
        border-bottom: 4px dotted green;
    }
    ```

6. **border-radius**: This property is used to add rounded borders to an element. You can set one radius for all 4 corners or individual radii for each corner. For example:

    ```css
    div {
        border-radius: 10px; /* all corners are rounded with a radius of 10 pixels */
    }

    div {
        border-radius: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top-left corner has a radius of 10 pixels, top-right 20 pixels, bottom-right 30 pixels, bottom-left 40 pixels */
    }
    ```

Those are the main properties for styling borders with CSS. They give you a lot of flexibility to create the exact look you want for your borders.
