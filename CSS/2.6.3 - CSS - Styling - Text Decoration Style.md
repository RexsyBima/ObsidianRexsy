The `text-decoration-style` CSS property is used to define the style of the line used for text decoration. The line could be an underline, overline, or line-through, as specified by `text-decoration-line`.

Here are the possible values for `text-decoration-style`:

1. **solid:** This is the default value, and it specifies a single line.

2. **double:** This value specifies a double line.

3. **dotted:** This value specifies a dotted line.

4. **dashed:** This value specifies a dashed line.

5. **wavy:** This value specifies a wavy line.

Here is the basic syntax:

```css
text-decoration-style: solid|double|dotted|dashed|wavy;
```

And here's an example of `text-decoration-style` in use:

```css
p {
    text-decoration-line: underline;
    text-decoration-style: wavy;
}
```

In this example, the text within the `<p>` (paragraph) elements would be underlined with a wavy line. 

You can also use `text-decoration-style` with the `text-decoration` shorthand property. Here's how:

```css
p {
    text-decoration: underline wavy;
}
```

This will do the same thing as the first example: underline the text within the `<p>` element with a wavy line.

Keep in mind that the `text-decoration-style` property will apply to all text decoration lines (whether they are underlines, overlines, or line-throughs) on the same text, so it's not possible to specify different styles for different kinds of text decorations on the same text.
