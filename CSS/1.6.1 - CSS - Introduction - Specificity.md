In CSS, specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, influenced by the number of each selector type in the matching selector. When multiple declarations have equal specificity, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the element. Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted; different elements are unaffected by each other's CSS specificity.

Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector is - the more specific a selector is, the higher its priority in the cascade.

Here's a basic rundown of how specificity values are calculated:

1. **Type selectors** (e.g., `h1`) and **pseudo-elements** (e.g., `::before`) have a specificity of 1.

2. **Class selectors** (e.g., `.example`), **attributes selectors** (e.g., `[type="radio"]`), and **pseudo-classes** (e.g., `:hover`) have a specificity of 10.

3. **ID selectors** (e.g., `#example`) have a specificity of 100.

4. **Inline styles** added to an element directly within the HTML itself (e.g., `style="font-weight: bold;"`) have a specificity of 1000.

5. The `!important` rule overrides any other declarations, but it's a last resort and generally a bad practice as it breaks the natural cascading in your stylesheets.

If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins. If two selectors have the same specificity, the last one defined wins.

Consider the following CSS:

```css
#navbar ul li a { color: red; } /* specificity = 1+10+1+1 = 13 */
body a { color: green; } /* specificity = 1+1 = 2 */
```

Even though `body a` is defined later, the color of the links inside the #navbar list will be red, because the first selector has a higher specificity.

Understanding specificity is crucial for mastering CSS as it can help you understand why some styles aren't being applied as expected and help you avoid the need for `!important` rules. 

That's the essence of CSS specificity. Let me know if you'd like to delve deeper into any aspect of it!
