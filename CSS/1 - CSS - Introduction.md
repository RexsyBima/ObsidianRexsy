CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It's a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, and reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.

Here are a few important points about CSS:

- **Cascading**: This means that the priority or weight of a given style rule decreases down the stylesheet. If multiple rules are defined for the same element, the browser follows a certain order to determine which rule takes precedence.

- **Selectors**: CSS uses selectors to bind style properties to elements in the HTML document. These selectors can be used to select elements based on their id, class, type, attribute, and more.

- **Properties**: Once you've selected an element with a selector, you can define various style properties for that element, such as color, font-size, width, background-color, and more.

- **Responsive Design**: CSS plays a key role in making a website responsive. With the help of media queries, you can create different layouts for different screen sizes.

- **Animations**: CSS can be used to create animations and transitions, providing an engaging user experience.

- **Preprocessors**: Tools like Sass, LESS, and Stylus allow you to write more dynamic and reusable CSS.

CSS has greatly evolved over the years and now includes advanced modules like Flexbox and Grid for complex layouts, Variables for reusable values, and many other features that allow developers to build beautifully styled, scalable, and maintainable web applications
