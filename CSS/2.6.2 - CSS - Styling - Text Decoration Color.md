The `text-decoration-color` CSS property sets the color of the underline, overline, or line-through on text in an element. It only works when `text-decoration-line` has been set and is not "none". 

Here's the basic syntax:

```css
text-decoration-color: color;
```

You can use named colors, hexadecimal color codes, RGB, RGBA, HSL, or HSLA values to specify the color.

Here's an example of `text-decoration-color` in use:

```css
p {
    text-decoration-line: underline;
    text-decoration-color: red;
}
```

In this example, the text within the `<p>` (paragraph) element would be underlined in red.

You can also use `text-decoration-color` with the `text-decoration` shorthand property. For instance:

```css
p {
    text-decoration: underline red;
}
```

This will do the same thing as the first example: underline the text within the `<p>` element in red.

Please note that the color applied by `text-decoration-color` will always apply to all text decorations, regardless of whether they are underlines, overlines, or line-throughs. It's not possible to specify different colors for different kinds of text decorations on the same text.
