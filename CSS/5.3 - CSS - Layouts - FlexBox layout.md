### What is FlexBox?
- A set of CSS properties for **building 1 dimensional layout**
- Allow browsers to automatically divide empty space inside a container element by its child element
- FlexBox make things easy for automatically **align items to one another** inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically
- FlexBox solves **vertical centering** and creating **equal-height columns**
- perfect to replace **floats**

### FlexBox terminology

The Flexible Box Layout Module, known as flexbox, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Here's a simple overview:

1. **Basics:** To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container. This is done by setting the `display` property to `flex` or `inline-flex` for the parent element.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

2. **Main Axis and Cross Axis:** Flexbox is a module that works in two dimensions: it has a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is defined by the `flex-direction` property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column */
}
```

3. **flex-direction:** This property specifies the direction of the main axis. It can take four values: `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`.

4. **justify-content:** This property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of a flex container. It is used when the total size of the flex items is less than the size of the container. It can take the following values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`.

5. **align-items:** This property defines how the browser distributes space between and around flex items along the cross-axis of their container. It can take the following values: `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`.

6. **flex-wrap:** By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that with `flex-wrap` property: `nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse`.

7. **flex-shrink and flex-grow:** These are used to decide how much a box should shrink or grow if there is extra space available in the container or if there is not enough space. They take a unitless value that serves as a proportion.

8. **order:** By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, `order` property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

Here is an example of a simple flex container with three items:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.container div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, there are three `<div>` elements within the flex container, and they're evenly spaced along the row.

Flexbox can be complex to understand initially, especially when it comes to the different axes and how `justify-content` and `align-items` work. It's a good idea to practice with different layouts and adjust the properties to see how the layout changes.
