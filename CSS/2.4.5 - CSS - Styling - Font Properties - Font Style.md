The `font-style` property in CSS is used to determine whether the font should be displayed as italic, oblique, or normal. The syntax of this property is as follows:

```css
element {
  font-style: value;
}
```

The values can be:

- `normal`: The text appears as normal, with no style applied.
- `italic`: The text will display in italic. It is a form of type style where the characters are slanted to the right.
- `oblique`: The text will display in oblique, which is somewhat similar to italic but less supported. Oblique characters may be artificially slanted where italic has been designed to look slanted.

Here are some examples:

```css
p.normal {
  font-style: normal;
}

p.italic {
  font-style: italic;
}

p.oblique {
  font-style: oblique;
}
```

In this example, the paragraph with the class `.normal` will have normal style text, `.italic` will have italic text, and `.oblique` will have oblique text.

Please note, not all font families have an italic or oblique face available, in which case the browser will mimic it, which may not always give the best result.
  
For the best results, use a font that has an italic and/or oblique face available. It's also worth noting that `italic` and `oblique` will give the same result in many typefaces, as not all fonts have a distinct style for both.
