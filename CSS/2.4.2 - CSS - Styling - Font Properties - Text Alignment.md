The `text-align` property in CSS is used to align the inner content of a block element. It can take four values:

1. **Left:** The `text-align: left;` rule aligns the text to the left, and this is the default for most languages. Example usage:

    ```css
    p {
      text-align: left;
    }
    ```

2. **Right:** The `text-align: right;` rule aligns the text to the right. Example usage:

    ```css
    p {
      text-align: right;
    }
    ```

3. **Center:** The `text-align: center;` rule centers the text. Example usage:

    ```css
    p {
      text-align: center;
    }
    ```

4. **Justify:** The `text-align: justify;` rule aligns the text to both left and right margins by adjusting the spacing between words. The last line in a paragraph will be left-aligned or right-aligned if the paragraph's direction is rtl. Example usage:

    ```css
    p {
      text-align: justify;
    }
    ```

It's worth noting that `text-align` property won't work with inline elements as these elements do not have a block-level container. To use `text-align`, the element must be block level, or you can use `display: block;` or `display: inline-block;` to make an inline element respect this property.

Also, remember that `text-align` property in CSS inherits, meaning that if you set `text-align: center;` on a parent element, all its child elements will also center their text. This behavior can be overridden by setting a different `text-align` value on a child element.

Here's a larger example:

```html
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p>This paragraph is centered.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">This paragraph is left-aligned.</p>
</div>
```

In this example, the first paragraph is centered because it inherits the `text-align` property from its parent `div`. The second paragraph is left-aligned, as it overrides the inherited `text-align` with its own.
