Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you dive deeper into the world of CSS.

Let's start with a general form of a CSS rule-set:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

**Selector**: This is the HTML element that you want to style. For example, if you wanted to style all `<p>` elements, `p` would be your selector.

**Property**: This is the characteristic of the element you want to change. For example, you might want to change the color, font size, background, etc.

**Value**: This is what you want to set the property to. For example, if you were changing color, the value might be 'red' or '#FF0000'.

Here's an example:

```css
p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

This CSS rule-set selects all `<p>` elements and sets their text color to red and font size to 20 pixels.

**Different types of selectors**

1. **Element selector**: Selects all elements with a given tag name.

   Example: 
   ```css
   p {
       color: red;
   }
   ```

2. **Class selector**: Selects all elements with a given class attribute. It's prefixed with a dot (.).

   Example:
   ```css
   .myClass {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```

3. **ID selector**: Selects an element with a specific id attribute. It's prefixed with a hash (#). 

   Example:
   ```css
   #myID {
       color: green;
   }
   ```

4. **Attribute selector**: Selects elements based on their attributes and attribute values.

   Example:
   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
       background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```

**Combinators and Pseudo-classes**

In addition to the basic selectors, CSS offers combinators like descendant (space), child (>), adjacent sibling (+), and general sibling (~) selectors. Also, there are pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, :active, :visited, :first-child, :last-child, and many more to select elements based on a certain state.

**Properties and Values**

There are hundreds of CSS properties you can use, each with its own set of acceptable values. For example, the `display` property controls how an element is displayed and can take values like `block`, `inline`, `none`, `flex`, `grid`, and so on.

Similarly, properties like `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`, `position`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and many others control various aspects of how an element is presented.

CSS also allows for complex features like animations, transitions, transformations, gradients, and more. It's a vast and powerful language that offers a lot of flexibility in how you style your web pages.
