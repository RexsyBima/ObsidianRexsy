The `href` attribute primarily used in conjunction with the `<a>` (anchor) tag in HTML to specify the destination of a link. Here's a simple example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

In this case, when a user clicks on "Visit Example.com", they are taken to the URL specified in the `href` attribute.

**Different uses of `href`**

1. **External Links**: As shown above, you can use `href` to link to an external webpage.

2. **Internal Links**: You can use `href` to link to another page within the same website. In this case, you use a relative path in the `href` attribute.

```html
<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
```

3. **Anchor Links**: You can also use `href` to link to a specific section within the same page. This requires an `id` on the target element. 

```html
<a href="#section2">Go to Section 2</a>
...
<div id="section2">You've arrived at Section 2</div>
```

**Tips and Tricks**

1. **Open in New Tab**: If you want the link to open in a new tab, you can add the `target` attribute with `_blank` as its value.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com</a>
```

2. **Add Tooltip**: The `title` attribute can be added to provide additional information about the link. This text will show up as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="This link will take you to example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

3. **Download Links**: If the `href` points to a downloadable file, you can add the `download` attribute to prompt the file to be downloaded when the user clicks the link.

```html
<a href="path/to/file.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
```

4. **Mailto Links**: You can create a link that opens the user's email program to send an email by using `mailto:` in the `href`.

```html
<a href="mailto:example@example.com">Send Email</a>
```

5. **Telephone Links**: Similarly, you can create a link that initiates a phone call in devices capable of making telephone calls by using `tel:` in the `href`.

```html
<a href="tel:1234567890">Call Us</a>
```
