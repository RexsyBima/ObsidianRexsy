Sure, let's talk about the `<header>` element in HTML!

The `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. It can contain some elements like:

- One or more heading elements (`<h1>`-`<h6>`)
- Logo or icon
- Authorship information
- Navigation (`<nav>`)
- Search form

Typically, a `<header>` element contains one or more heading elements but it does not have to. It can also contain other types of content.

For instance, a simple website might have a header like this:

```html
<header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
    <p>A short description of the website...</p>
</header>
```

In a more complex layout, the header might include navigation links:

```html
<header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

Or even a search form:

```html
<header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <form>
        <input type="search" placeholder="Search this website...">
        <input type="submit" value="Search">
    </form>
</header>
```

A couple of things to remember about the `<header>` element:

1. **Not Section-Specific**: The `<header>` element is not section-specific. It can be used with any block-level element aside from the `<footer>` element. 

2. **Multiple Headers**: It is also completely acceptable to have multiple `<header>` elements in your HTML document. For example, you might have a global header for your entire webpage and also a `<header>` for individual `<article>` elements or `<section>` elements.

3. **Not Always Necessary**: Not all elements need a `<header>`. Use a `<header>` element when it makes sense from a design perspective, and when it helps improve the structure and readability of your code.

In CSS, the `<header>` tag can be styled just like any other HTML element to align with the design needs of the page. You might set background colors, add a logo, align text, and more based on your design requirements. 

The `<header>` element is a semantic element in HTML5. Semantic elements are used to give meaning to the structure of the web content. Using these elements appropriately makes your web page more accessible and better indexed by search engines.
