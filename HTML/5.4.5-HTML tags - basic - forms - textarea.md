Sure thing, Rexsy! A `<textarea>` element in HTML is used to gather larger amounts of text from a user. It can be very useful for things like comments, reviews, or any other situation where you need the user to input more than just a single line of text.

Here's a basic example:

```html
<form>
  <label for="message">Message:</label><br>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="50">
  </textarea>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this form, the `<textarea>` element creates a multi-line text input (a text area) where users can input text. The `rows` attribute specifies the visible number of lines in the text area, and the `cols` attribute specifies the visible width of the text area, as a number of average-sized characters.

The `id` attribute is used to associate the `<label>` with the `<textarea>`. This improves accessibility by allowing screen readers to read the label when the user interacts with the text area.

Note that if you put text between the opening `<textarea>` tag and closing `</textarea>` tag, that text will be the default text in the text area:

```html
<textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="50">
Hello there!
</textarea>
```

In this case, "Hello there!" would be the default text in the text area. However, it's more common to leave the text area empty and let the user fill it in.
