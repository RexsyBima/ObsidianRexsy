Sure, Rexsy! Labels are very important in HTML forms, not just for user experience but also for accessibility. They are represented by the `<label>` tag.

Labels are associated with form controls (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>`) through the `for` attribute on the label, which corresponds to the `id` attribute on the associated form control.

Here's an example of how you can label an input:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this form, the labels "Name:" and "Email:" are associated with the corresponding inputs through the use of the `for` attribute. This means that when a user clicks on the label, it will give focus to the corresponding input field. This is helpful for users, but especially important for people using screen readers or other assistive technologies, as it clearly identifies what input a label corresponds to.

Also, note that it is considered a good practice to use the `<br>` tag after each label to ensure that each input appears on a new line, making the form easier to read and use.
