# HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an element, define its properties, or configure an element's behavior in certain ways.

Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"` and are always defined in the start tag of an HTML element. Here are some commonly used HTML attributes:

1. **class**: 
	This attribute is used to specify one or more class names for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. But it can also be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
	
	Example:
```HTML
<div class="myClass">This is a text inside a div element.</div>
```

Rule for **class** :
- The `class` attribute is used when you want to target a **group of elements** or an element that isn't necessarily unique.
- Multiple elements can have the same `class`, and a single element can have multiple classes.
- The `class` is used for styling a group of elements with CSS or accessing a group of elements with JavaScript.
- You should use `class` when you want to style multiple elements in the same way.

2. **id**: 
	The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. It is mostly used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript to manipulate the element with the specific id.
	
	Example:
```HTML
<div id="myID">This is another text inside a div element.</div>
```

Rule for **ID** :
- The `id` attribute is used when you need to target a **specific, unique element** on the page.
- An `id` must be **unique** within the page. No two elements can have the same `id`.
- The `id` can be used for bookmarking a section on the page, styling a specific element with CSS, or accessing a specific element with JavaScript.
- You should use `id` when you know that only one element on the page would require a specific style or when you need to select a specific element with JavaScript.

3. **style**: 
	The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. It's a good practice to keep your CSS separate from HTML in an external style sheet, but this can be useful for small projects or testing.
	
	Example:
```HTML
<p style="color:blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

4. **src**: 
	The src attribute is required for elements like `<img>`, `<script>`, and `<iframe>`. It specifies the source URL for an image, a script, or a frame.

	Example:
```HTML
<img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">
```

5. **alt**: 
	The alt attribute provides an alternative description for an image. It's displayed if for some reason the image cannot be loaded and is also useful for accessibility purposes, as screen readers use this to describe images to visually impaired users.

	Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
```

6. **href**: The href attribute is used in anchor (`<a>`) tags to specify the URL of the page the link goes to. [[4.1 -HTML attributes - href]]

	Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

7. **width** and **height**: These attributes are used to specify the width and height of elements like `<img>`, `<table>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `<canvas>`, and `<iframe>`.

	Example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image" width="500" height="600">
```
