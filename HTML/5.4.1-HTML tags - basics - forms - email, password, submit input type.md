Absolutely, Rexsy! Let's delve into these different input types in HTML forms.

1. **Email (`type="email"`)**: This input type is used for input fields that should contain an email address. It looks like a text box, but the browser may provide some validation and may alter its keyboard to facilitate email input on mobile devices.

   Example:
   ```html
   <label for="email">Email:</label>
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
   ```

2. **Password (`type="password"`)**: This input type is used for input fields that should contain a password. It looks like a text box, but the browser obscures the input to protect the password from over-the-shoulder peeping.

   Example:
   ```html
   <label for="pwd">Password:</label>
   <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
   ```

3. **Submit (`type="submit"`)**: This input type is used to create a button that submits the form. The button can be customized using CSS.

   Example:
   ```html
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   ```

   Note: The `value` attribute specifies the text to display on the button.

4. **Color (`type="color"`)**: This input type is used for input fields that should contain a color. It provides a color picker interface.

   Example:
   ```html
   <label for="favcolor">Select your favorite color:</label>
   <input type="color" id="favcolor" name="favcolor">
   ```

Here's how you can combine all of them in a form:

```html
<form action="/submit_form" method="post">
  <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br>
  <label for="pwd">Password:</label><br>
  <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" required><br>
  <label for="favcolor">Select your favorite color:</label><br>
  <input type="color" id="favcolor" name="favcolor"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

This form includes input fields for email and password (both required), a color picker, and a submit button. When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the form data is sent for processing to a page on the server named "/submit_form". The form data is sent as a HTTP post request.
