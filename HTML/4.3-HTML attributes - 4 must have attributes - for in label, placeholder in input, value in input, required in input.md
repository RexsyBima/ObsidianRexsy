Sure thing, Rexsy! Let's dive into those topics.

1. **`for` attribute in `<label>`**: As we discussed earlier, the `for` attribute associates a label with a form control (like an input) via the `id` of the form control. This improves accessibility and usability because clicking on the label focuses or activates the associated control. 

   Example:
   ```html
   <label for="fname">First name:</label>
   <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">
   ```

2. **`placeholder` attribute in `<input>`**: The `placeholder` attribute provides a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g., sample value or brief description). It's displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

   Example:
   ```html
   <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" placeholder="Your last name..">
   ```

3. **`value` attribute in `<input>`**: The `value` attribute specifies the initial value for an input field. When the page loads, this is the data that you'll see already populated in the field.

   Example:
   ```html
   <input type="text" id="city" name="city" value="Jakarta">
   ```

4. **`required` attribute in `<input>`**: The `required` attribute is a boolean attribute (meaning it doesn't need a value). When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before the user can submit the form. 

   Example:
   ```html
   <input type="text" id="email" name="email" required>
   ```

Here's how you might combine all four in a form:

```html
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Enter your first name" required>

  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" placeholder="Enter your last name" required>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
Output :

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Enter your first name" required>

  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" placeholder="Enter your last name" required>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

In this example, the user will see "Enter your first name" and "Enter your last name" as hints in the text fields. Those fields are also marked as required, so if the user tries to submit the form without providing those values, they'll see an error message.
