Certainly, Rexsy! The `action` and `method` attributes of the `<form>` element are key to understanding how data is sent from the client to the server.

1. **Action**: The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when a form is submitted. Typically, the `action` value is the URL (or URI) of the server-side script that will process the collected data. This could be the URL of another webpage.

   Here's an example:

   ```html
   <form action="https://www.example.com/submit_form" method="get">
   ```

   In this example, when the form is submitted, the data will be sent to `https://www.example.com/submit_form`.

2. **Method**: The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data. The `get` method appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs: `URL?name=value&name=value`.

   The `get` method is the default HTTP method when the `method` attribute is not specified. It's good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google. However, because the data is appended to the URL, there are length limitations, and you risk exposing sensitive data in the URL / browser history / server logs.

   If you want to send a large amount of secure data, such as a file, you should use the `post` method instead.

Here's a simple form example using the `get` method:

```html
<form action="https://www.example.com/submit_form" method="get">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In this example, if you enter "John" for "First name" and "Doe" for "Last name" and submit the form, the browser will take you to a URL like `https://www.example.com/submit_form?fname=John&lname=Doe`. The server-side script at that URL would then process the form data.
