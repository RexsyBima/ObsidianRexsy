In HTML, you have several tags that can be used to apply formatting to text. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. **Bold text**: The `<strong>` tag is used to define important text, and the browser will typically display it as bold text. Another tag that can bold text is the `<b>` tag, but it does not denote that its content is important.

```html
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
<b>This text is bold</b>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<strong>This text is important!</strong>
<b>This text is bold</b>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2. **Italic text**: The `<em>` tag is used to define emphasized text, and the browser will typically display it as italic text. Another tag that can italicize text is the `<i>` tag, but it does not denote that its content is emphasized.

```html
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
<i>This text is in italics</i>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<em>This text is emphasized</em>
<i>This text is in italics</i>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
3. **Underlined text**: The `<u>` tag was originally used to underline text, but is now officially defined as a tag to style text in an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as misspelled.

```html
<u>This text is underlined</u>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<u>This text is underlined</u>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

However, if you want to underline text, it's usually better to use CSS:

```html
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This text is underlined</span>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This text is underlined</span>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
4. **Strikethrough text**: The `<del>` tag is used to mark deleted text, and the `<s>` tag is used to represent text that is no longer relevant or accurate. Both tags display text with a strikethrough.

```html
<del>This text is deleted</del>
<s>This text is no longer relevant</s>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<del>This text is deleted</del>
<s>This text is no longer relevant</s>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
5. **Subscript and Superscript**: The `<sub>` and `<sup>` tags are used to define subscript and superscript text.

```html
H<sub>2</sub>O is the chemical formula for water.
E = mc<sup>2</sup> is Einstein's theory of relativity.
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
H<sub>2</sub>O is the chemical formula for water.
E = mc<sup>2</sup> is Einstein's theory of relativity.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6. **Marked or Highlighted text**: The `<mark>` tag is used to highlight parts of your text.

```html
<mark>This part of text is highlighted</mark>
```
Output:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
<mark>This part of text is highlighted</mark>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Remember, HTML is not primarily a formatting language**. While it does have some tags for text formatting, for more advanced or detailed styles, it's better to use CSS. CSS provides you with a great range of options to style and layout your website in a more maintainable way.
