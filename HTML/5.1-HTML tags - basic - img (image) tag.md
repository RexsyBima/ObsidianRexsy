## The `<img>` tag is a self-closing HTML tag used to display images on a webpage. Its main attribute is `src` (short for source), which specifies the path to the image file. 

Here's a basic use of an image tag:

```html
<img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```

Let's dig into more attributes and their usage:

1. **`alt`**: This attribute provides alternative text for an image. It's displayed in the event the image can't be loaded, and it's also used by screen readers for visually impaired users. It's considered best practice to always include an `alt` attribute with a meaningful description.

```html
<img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset over the ocean">
```

2. **`width`** and **`height`**: These attributes define the width and height of an image. The value is specified in pixels by default, but it can also be set in percent. However, it's usually better to control the image dimensions using CSS to ensure more flexibility and maintain aspect ratio. 

```html
<img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="500" height="400">
```

3. **`title`**: This attribute provides advisory information about the image and it usually displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.

```html
<img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="Description of image" title="Hover text here">
```

Now, here are some tips and tricks:

- **Responsive images**: To make an image responsive (automatically resize based on the device), you can use CSS:

  ```html
  <style>
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
  </style>
  ```

- **Lazy loading**: In modern browsers, you can use the `loading="lazy"` attribute to defer loading of images that are off-screen until you scroll to them, improving initial page load time:

  ```html
  <img src="path_to_your_image.jpg" alt="Description of image" loading="lazy">
  ```

- **Picture element**: You can use the `<picture>` and `<source>` elements to specify multiple sources for an image, in order to provide versions of the image for different display/scaling scenarios:

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_pink_flowers.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_white_flower.jpg">
    <img src="img_orange_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;">
  </picture>
  ```

Remember, using images wisely will make your website more accessible and performant. Always optimize your images (resize, compress) before using them in a web project.
