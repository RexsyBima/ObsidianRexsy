# The `<div>` and `<span>` tags are important tools in HTML that are used to group and structure content.

## **`<div>`:**
The `<div>` tag is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. It is used as a container that groups other elements together into a block.

Here's an example of how you might use a `<div>`:

```HTML
<div>
  <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph about me and my website.</p>
</div>
```

## **`<span>`:**
The `<span>` tag, on the other hand, is an inline element, meaning it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. It's used to group a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph).

Here's an example of how you might use a `<span>`:

```HTML
<p>My mother is <span style="color:blue">beautiful</span> and kind.</p>
```

In this example, the text "beautiful" will appear in blue color, while the rest of the sentence will use the default text color.

Both `<div>` and `<span>` tags are used alongside CSS to style sections of your document. On their own, they don't represent anything. Instead, they serve as ways to create sections in your HTML document that you can apply styles to.
