 A function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript, and it can be stored in a variable. The function as a whole can then be treated like a value that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to other functions, and so forth.

Here's a simple function expression:

```javascript
let greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, Reksy!');
};

// Invoke the function
greet();  // Outputs: Hello, Reksy!
```

In the code above, the function is anonymous (it has no name), and it's assigned to the variable `greet`. We can invoke this function by using the variable name followed by parentheses `()`.

Function expressions are not hoisted, unlike function declarations. This means that you cannot use a function expression before defining it:

```javascript
sayHello();  // Outputs: TypeError: sayHello is not a function

var sayHello = function() {
  console.log('Hello there!');
};
```

In the code above, calling `sayHello()` before it's defined results in a `TypeError`, because the function expression hasn't been assigned to the `sayHello` variable yet at the time it's called.

Another important feature of function expressions is that they can be **anonymous** (as in the first example) or **named**. Here's an example of a named function expression:

```javascript
let greet = function greeting() {
  console.log('Hello, Reksy!');
};

greet();  // Outputs: Hello, Reksy!
```

In this example, the function expression is named `greeting`, but it's still stored in the `greet` variable. You can invoke the function using the variable name `greet()`, not `greeting()`. The function's name can be useful for self-reference, for example, for recursive functions (functions that call themselves).

The ability to assign functions to variables allows for a lot of flexibility in JavaScript. This is a major part of JavaScript's functional programming aspect, where functions can be passed around and used as data.
