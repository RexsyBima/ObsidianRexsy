The primary differences between `for` and `while` loops are related to their syntax and when you should use them:

**Syntax:**

- A `for` loop requires you to declare a loop counter or iterator, a condition for continuing the loop, and an increment value. The loop continues until the condition is no longer met.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);  // Will print values from 0 to 4
}
```

- A `while` loop only requires a condition. The condition is checked before each iteration, and if it evaluates to `true`, the loop continues. 

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);  // Will print values from 0 to 4
    i++;
}
```

**Usage:**

- Use a `for` loop when you know in advance how many times the loop should run. For example, iterating over an array or repeating a fixed number of times.

- Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition that will change during the execution of the loop. For instance, when you are waiting for a specific condition to become `true` or `false`.

Overall, both types of loops are quite flexible and can often be used interchangeably, but these are the general guidelines that can help you decide which one to use in a specific situation.
