The `typeof` operator in JavaScript returns a string indicating the type of the operand. The operand can be either a literal or a data structure such as an object. The `typeof` operator is a unary operator; that is, it only operates on a single operand.

Here's a quick overview of the `typeof` operator with different data types:

```javascript
console.log(typeof 42); // Outputs: "number"
console.log(typeof 'Hello'); // Outputs: "string"
console.log(typeof true); // Outputs: "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // Outputs: "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // Outputs: "object" (this is considered a bug in JavaScript, null is not really an object)
console.log(typeof [1,2,3]); // Outputs: "object"
console.log(typeof {name: 'Rexsy'}); // Outputs: "object"
console.log(typeof function() {}); // Outputs: "function"
console.log(typeof Symbol('id')); // Outputs: "symbol"
console.log(typeof 9007199254740992n); // Outputs: "bigint"
```

It's important to understand that `typeof` distinguishes between primitive types like string, number, boolean, undefined, bigint, symbol, and object types. Array, function, and null types are technically considered objects in JavaScript, which can sometimes be confusing. 

Also, if a variable has not been declared, `typeof` will return `"undefined"` as well. So it's a handy way to check if a variable exists in the current scope:

```javascript
console.log(typeof undeclaredVariable); // Outputs: "undefined"
```
