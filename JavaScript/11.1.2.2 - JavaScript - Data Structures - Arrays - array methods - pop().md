Certainly, Rexsy. Let's explore the `pop()` method in JavaScript arrays.

The `pop()` method is a built-in JavaScript method for arrays that is used to remove the last element from an array. It returns the removed element. This method changes the length of the array.

Here's the syntax of the `pop()` method:
```javascript
arr.pop()
```
The `pop()` method does not take any parameters. 

Here's an example of how you might use the `pop()` method:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango'];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits);  // Output: ["apple", "banana"]
console.log(lastFruit);  // Output: "mango"
```

In this example, we have an array called `fruits` that contains three elements. We use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the array ('mango') and assign it to the `lastFruit` variable. When we print the array, we see that it now contains only the first two elements. When we print `lastFruit`, it shows 'mango', which is the element that was removed from the array.

Please note that `pop()` modifies the original array, and it will return `undefined` if you call it on an empty array.

```javascript
let emptyArray = [];
console.log(emptyArray.pop());  // Output: undefined
``` 

This indicates that there was no element to remove and return. It's important to check that your array contains elements before calling `pop()` to avoid unexpected `undefined` values.
