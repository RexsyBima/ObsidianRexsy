### What is Javascript?
"JavaScript is a **high-level**, **object-oriented**, **multi-paradigm** programming language"
																								**-Jonas Schmedtmann**
																								
1. **High Level** = No need to worry about complex stuff like memory management
2. **Object Oriented** = Based on objects, for storing most kind of data
3. **Multi Paradigm** = We can use different styles of programming (Imparative or declarative)

### What is Programming Language?
is a language that instruct computers to do something

## Javascript Role in Web Development
JavaScript plays a fundamental role in web development and is one of the three pillars that form the structure of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. Here's an overview of its importance:

1. **Interactive Websites:** JavaScript breathes life into static HTML pages by making them interactive. This can range from simple things like displaying pop-up messages or validating form data to more complex actions such as animating 2D/3D graphics or controlling multimedia.

2. **Client-Side Scripting:** Originally, JavaScript was primarily used as a client-side scripting language, which means it runs directly in the user's browser. This allows for real-time updates, dynamic changes, and improved user interactivity without needing to refresh the page.

3. **Server-Side Scripting:** With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to use the same language for both frontend and backend development. This encourages code reusability and streamlines the development process.

4. **Web Applications:** JavaScript, in combination with various libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, allows developers to build robust, complex web applications. These tools provide useful features such as two-way data binding, modular architecture, and reusable components.

5. **Asynchronous Behavior:** JavaScript introduced the concept of asynchronous behavior to the web. This means it can communicate with the server, perform operations, and update the web page without having to reload the entire page. Features such as AJAX, Promises, and async/await support this.

6. **Web APIs & JSON:** JavaScript provides numerous Web APIs that developers can use to accomplish complex tasks, such as Fetch API for network requests or Web Storage API for storing data in the user's browser. Also, JSON, a data format extensively used for asynchronous server-client communication, is native to JavaScript.

7. **Real-Time Applications:** With technologies like WebSockets and libraries like Socket.IO, JavaScript can power real-time applications like chat applications, live video streaming platforms, and multiplayer online games.

8. **Mobile App Development:** JavaScript can also be used to develop mobile applications. Frameworks like React Native or Ionic let you write mobile apps using JavaScript, which are then compiled to run natively on different mobile platforms.

9. **Testing and Automation:** JavaScript includes a wide range of libraries and frameworks for automated testing, like Mocha, Jest, Jasmine, etc., which help in maintaining the codebase and ensure its robustness and reliability.

So in essence, JavaScript is an essential tool in a web developer's toolbox. From crafting simple websites to building complex web applications, JavaScript has capabilities that extend far and wide in the realm of web development.
