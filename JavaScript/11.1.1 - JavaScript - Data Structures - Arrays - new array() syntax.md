The `new Array()` syntax is another way to create an array in JavaScript, typically known as the array constructor.

Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
let fruits = new Array('Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry');
```

In the example above, the `new Array()` constructor creates an array `fruits` with three elements.

The `new Array()` constructor is flexible in that it can take any number of arguments:

- No arguments: Creates an empty array.
- One argument (number): Creates an array with the length provided, but no values.
- One argument (not a number): Creates an array with the argument as the first element.
- Multiple arguments: Creates an array with the arguments as elements.

For example:

```javascript
let empty = new Array(); // Creates an empty array.
let arrayWithLength = new Array(10); // Creates an array of length 10, but no values.
let arrayWithElement = new Array('Apple'); // Creates an array with 'Apple' as the first element.
let arrayWithElements = new Array('Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'); // Creates an array with the arguments as elements.
```

However, using `new Array()` can lead to some confusion, especially when you pass a single numeric argument. Because of these potential complications, it's generally recommended to use the array literal syntax (`[]`) for array creation.
