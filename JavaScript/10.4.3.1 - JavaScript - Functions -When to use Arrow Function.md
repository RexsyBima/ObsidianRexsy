Arrow functions are a great feature of JavaScript that can make your code more concise and easier to read. Here are some situations where using an arrow function can be especially beneficial:

1. **Non-method functions:** Arrow functions are best suited for non-method functions. If you're defining a function that's not a method (not attached to an object or class), an arrow function is often a good choice.

2. **Callbacks and Inline Functions:** Arrow functions really shine when used as inline functions or callbacks, due to their concise syntax. They are often used with array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, etc.

   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   let squares = numbers.map(num => num * num); // [1, 4, 9, 16]
   ```

3. **When 'this' needs to be Bound to Parent Scope:** One of the key features of arrow functions is that they do not bind their own `this` value. Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope. This can be particularly useful when dealing with event listeners or methods in classes, where you want `this` to refer to the object the method belongs to, and not the caller of the function.

   ```javascript
   class MyClass {
     constructor() {
       this.value = 10;
     }

     startTimer() {
       setInterval(() => {
         this.value++;
         console.log(this.value); 
       }, 1000);
     }
   }

   const myInstance = new MyClass();
   myInstance.startTimer(); // Outputs 11, 12, 13... every second
   ```

However, there are also times when arrow functions are not the best choice:

- **Object Methods:** Since arrow functions do not have their own `this`, they are not ideal to use for object methods if you need to access other properties on the object.

- **Constructor Functions:** Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. They will throw an error if used with `new`.

- **Function that Needs a Prototype:** Arrow functions do not have a `prototype` property. So if you're working with JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, you should use a regular function.

- **Generator Functions:** Arrow functions cannot be used as generator functions. For generators, you would need to use the `function*` syntax.

Remember, while arrow functions can lead to shorter and cleaner code, it's important to consider readability and clarity above all. If the function would be easier to understand as a traditional function, then there's no need to use an arrow function.
