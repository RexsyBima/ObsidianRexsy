Sure, Rexsy. The `shift()` method is another useful array method in JavaScript.

The `shift()` method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. 

Here is the basic syntax for `shift()`:

```javascript
arr.shift()
```

This method does not accept any parameters. When you call `shift()`, it removes the first element from the array and returns it.

Here's an example of how you might use `shift()`:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango'];
let removedFruit = fruits.shift();

console.log(fruits); // Output: ['banana', 'mango']
console.log(removedFruit); // Output: 'apple'
```

In this example, calling `shift()` on the `fruits` array removes 'apple' and returns it. The `fruits` array is updated to reflect that 'apple' has been removed. The `shift()` method returns the element that was removed, which we stored in the `removedFruit` variable. When we print `removedFruit`, it shows 'apple', which is the fruit that was removed.

Remember that `shift()` modifies the original array. If you want to remove the first element of an array without modifying the original array, you would need to use a different method or technique.
