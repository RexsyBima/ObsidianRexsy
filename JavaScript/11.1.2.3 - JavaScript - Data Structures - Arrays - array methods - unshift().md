Absolutely, Rexsy. Let's delve into the `unshift()` method in JavaScript arrays.

The `unshift()` method is a built-in JavaScript function that can be used on arrays. This method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. The `unshift()` method changes the original array.

Here's the syntax for `unshift()`:

```javascript
arr.unshift(element1, ..., elementN)
```

Where `element1, ..., elementN` are the elements to add to the start of the array.

Here's an example of how to use `unshift()`:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango'];
let newLength = fruits.unshift('kiwi');

console.log(fruits); // Output: ["kiwi", "apple", "banana", "mango"]
console.log(newLength); // Output: 4
```

In this example, we used `unshift()` to add 'kiwi' to the beginning of the `fruits` array. The `unshift()` method returns the new length of the array, which we stored in `newLength`. When we print the `fruits` array, we see that 'kiwi' has been added to the start of the array. When we print `newLength`, it shows '4', which is the new length of the array.

Remember that `unshift()` modifies the original array. If you need to add an element to the beginning of the array without modifying the original array, you would need to use a different method or technique.
