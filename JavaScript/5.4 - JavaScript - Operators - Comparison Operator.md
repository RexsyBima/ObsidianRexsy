Of course, Rexsy. In JavaScript, comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. Here are the basic comparison operators in JavaScript:

1. **Equality (`==`):** This operator checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, it returns true. If not, it returns false. It performs type coercion if the types are different.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 == "5"); // Outputs: true
   ```

2. **Inequality (`!=`):** This operator checks if the values of two operands are not equal. If not equal, it returns true. If equal, it returns false. It also performs type coercion if needed.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 != "5"); // Outputs: false
   ```

3. **Strict Equality (`===`):** This operator checks if the value and type of two operands are equal. If both conditions are met, it returns true. If not, it returns false. Unlike the Equality operator, it does not perform type coercion.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 === "5"); // Outputs: false
   console.log(5 === 5); // Outputs: true
   ```

4. **Strict Inequality (`!==`):** This operator checks if the value or type of two operands are not equal. If either condition is met, it returns true. If not, it returns false. It also does not perform type coercion.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 !== "5"); // Outputs: true
   console.log(5 !== 5); // Outputs: false
   ```

5. **Greater Than (`>`):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If yes, it returns true. If not, it returns false.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 > 3); // Outputs: true
   ```

6. **Less Than (`<`):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If yes, it returns true. If not, it returns false.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 < 3); // Outputs: false
   ```

7. **Greater Than or Equal to (`>=`):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, it returns true. If not, it returns false.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 >= 5); // Outputs: true
   console.log(5 >= 4); // Outputs: true
   ```

8. **Less Than or Equal to (`<=`):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If yes, it returns true. If not, it returns false.

   ```javascript
   console.log(5 <= 5); // Outputs: true
   console.log(5 <= 6); // Outputs: true
   ```

These comparison operators are often used in control structures like `if`, `else if`, `while`, `do while` and `for` loops, to determine the flow of the program. 

Just remember, when comparing data in JavaScript, it is often better to use the strict equality (`===`) and strict inequality (`!==`) operators, as they do not perform type coercion and therefore can prevent unexpected results.
