To loop over an array backwards in JavaScript, you start with the last index of the array (which is the length of the array minus 1, since array indexing starts at 0) and decrease the index on each iteration of the loop until you reach the first index (0). Here's an example:

```javascript
let arr = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'grape', 'mango'];

for(let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

In this example, `i` starts at the last index of `arr` (which is 4, since `arr` has 5 elements). On each iteration of the loop, `i` is decremented by 1 (`i--`), and the element at index `i` is logged to the console. This continues until `i` reaches 0, at which point the loop stops.

So the output of the above code will be:

```
mango
grape
banana
orange
apple
```

This is the reverse order of the elements in `arr`, because we started from the end of the array and moved towards the beginning.
