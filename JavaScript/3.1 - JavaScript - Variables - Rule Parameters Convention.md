Let's discuss the rules and conventions for naming variables in JavaScript.

1. **Case Sensitivity:** Variable names are case-sensitive. That means `myVariable` and `myvariable` would refer to two different variables.

2. **Start With:** A variable name must start with a letter, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`). They cannot start with a number.

   ```javascript
   let validVariable1 = 1;
   let _alsoValid = 2;
   let $anotherValidOne = 3;
   ```

3. **No Spaces or Special Characters:** Apart from the underscore and dollar sign, variable names cannot contain spaces or any special characters.

4. **No Reserved Words:** Variable names can't be any of JavaScript's reserved words. Reserved words are words that are part of the language syntax. For example, `let`, `const`, `function`, `class`, `return`, `break`, etc.

5. **No Digits at the Start:** A variable name can include numbers, but it cannot start with them.

   ```javascript
   let variable1 = 'good'; // This is okay
   let 1variable = 'bad';  // This will throw an error
   ```

6. **Unicode is Allowed:** JavaScript variables can use any character in the Unicode character set, which includes alphabets from other languages, emojis, and special characters.

   ```javascript
   let Î≥ÄÏàò = 'Hello in Korean';
   let üê∂ = 'dog';
   ```

Apart from these rules, there are certain conventions (not required, but good to follow):

1. **camelCase:** JavaScript developers typically use camelCase for variable names. In camelCase, the first letter of the variable is lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is uppercase. For example: `myVariableName`.

2. **Meaningful Names:** Variables should have meaningful names that describe the data they are holding. A variable named `userAge` is more understandable than a variable named `x`.

3. **Avoid Global Variables:** It's generally a good idea to avoid global variables when possible because they can conflict with other scripts.

Understanding and adhering to these rules and conventions will help you write clean and understandable code, making it easier to maintain and debug.
