Certainly, Rexsy! In JavaScript, you can certainly have functions call other functions. This is often referred to as **"Function Composition"** or **"Higher-Order Functions"** and is a fundamental concept in many functional programming languages, including JavaScript.

A function becomes a higher-order function when it takes a function as an argument, or returns a function, or both.

Here's an example:

```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

function addOne(x) {
  return x + 1;
}

function squareAndAddOne(x) {
  return addOne(square(x));
}

console.log(squareAndAddOne(4)); // Outputs 17
```

In the above example, the function `squareAndAddOne` calls the `square` function, and then the `addOne` function, hence functions are calling other functions.

Let's take a look at another example, using a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

function farewell(name) {
  console.log(`Goodbye, ${name}!`);
}

function processPerson(action, name) {
  action(name);
}

processPerson(greet, 'Rexsy'); // Outputs "Hello, Rexsy!"
processPerson(farewell, 'Rexsy'); // Outputs "Goodbye, Rexsy!"
```

In this example, `processPerson` is a higher-order function that takes a function (`action`) as an argument, along with a `name`. It then calls the `action` function, passing the `name` as an argument. We call `processPerson` twice, once with `greet` as the action, and once with `farewell`.

This ability to have functions call other functions allows for greater modularity and reusability in your code. You can define a function once, and then use it in multiple places throughout your code. This makes your code easier to maintain and understand.
