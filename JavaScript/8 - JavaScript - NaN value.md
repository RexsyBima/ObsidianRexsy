`NaN` is a special value in JavaScript, and it stands for "Not a Number." It's a result of an undefined or unrepresentable value in mathematical operations.

For example, trying to parse a non-numeric string or undefined into a number can result in `NaN`:

```javascript
let notNumber = Number('hello'); // NaN, because 'hello' is not a number
console.log(notNumber); // Outputs: NaN
```

You'll also get `NaN` as the result when you try to perform arithmetic operations that are mathematically undefined, like dividing zero by zero:

```javascript
let undefinedOperation = 0/0; // NaN, because division of 0 by 0 is mathematically undefined
console.log(undefinedOperation); // Outputs: NaN
```

`NaN` has some unique properties:

1. `NaN` is the only JavaScript value that is treated as unequal to itself. You can't use `==` or `===` to determine whether a value is `NaN` or not.

    ```javascript
    console.log(NaN === NaN); // Outputs: false
    ```

2. To check if a value is `NaN`, you should use the `isNaN()` function:

    ```javascript
    console.log(isNaN(NaN)); // Outputs: true
    ```

3. The type of `NaN` is Number:

    ```javascript
    console.log(typeof NaN); // Outputs: "number"
    ```

Despite the somewhat confusing name, `NaN` is used to indicate a missing numeric value or an operation that yields an undefined numerical result.
