JavaScript has indeed an interesting history of updates. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, under the name Mocha, later LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript. Here's a broad overview of its major updates and evolutions:

1. **ES1 (ECMAScript 1) - 1997**: This was the first edition of ECMA-262 standards, which is JavaScript as we know it. It established a lot of the basic features of the language.

2. **ES2 (ECMAScript 2) - 1998**: This update was more about aligning with an ISO standard. No real changes to the language.

3. **ES3 (ECMAScript 3) - 1999**: Significant features were introduced in this version, including exceptions, better string handling, and more. 

4. **ES4 (ECMAScript 4) - Abandoned**: This was an ambitious update that was ultimately abandoned due to disagreements between parties involved.

5. **ES5 (ECMAScript 5) - 2009**: Introduced after a decade, this update came with important features like "strict mode," accessor properties, better support for JSON, and more.

6. **ES5.1 (ECMAScript 5.1) - 2011**: This was a minor update mostly to keep ECMA and ISO standards aligned.

7. **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) - 2015**: One of the most significant updates to JavaScript. It introduced many features that modern JavaScript relies on heavily, such as classes, modules, arrow functions, promises, template strings, spread and rest operators, and more. 

8. **ES7 (ECMAScript 2016) - 2016**: This was a smaller update that introduced the Array.prototype.includes function and the exponentiation operator (**).

9. **ES8 (ECMAScript 2017) - 2017**: Introduced async/await syntax for handling promises, Object.entries/values, string padding, and more.

10. **ES9 (ECMAScript 2018) - 2018**: Added features like asynchronous iteration, Promise.finally, rest/spread properties, and more.

11. **ES10 (ECMAScript 2019) - 2019**: This update included Array.prototype.flat/flatMap, Object.fromEntries, and more.

12. **ES11 (ECMAScript 2020) - 2020**: Notable features included BigInt for dealing with big integers, dynamic import, nullish coalescing operator (??), optional chaining (?.), and more.

Since 2015, the ECMAScript specification has moved to a yearly release cycle, so we can expect annual updates to the language. Each update brings with it new features, syntax, and improvements to help JavaScript developers write cleaner, more efficient, and more manageable code. Keep an eye out for future updates to stay current with your JavaScript development skills.
