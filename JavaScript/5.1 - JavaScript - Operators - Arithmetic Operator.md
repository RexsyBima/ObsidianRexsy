Let's dive deeper into arithmetic operators in JavaScript. Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value. Here are the main arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: This operator adds two numbers together.

    ```javascript
    let sum = 5 + 10; // sum will be 15
    ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: This operator subtracts the second operand from the first.

    ```javascript
    let difference = 20 - 5; // difference will be 15
    ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: This operator multiplies two numbers together.

    ```javascript
    let product = 5 * 10; // product will be 50
    ```

4. **Division (`/`)**: This operator divides the first operand by the second.

    ```javascript
    let quotient = 20 / 5; // quotient will be 4
    ```

5. **Modulus (`%`)**: This operator returns the remainder left when the first operand is divided by the second operand.

    ```javascript
    let remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder will be 1
    ```

6. **Increment (`++`)**: This operator increases the value of a variable by 1. It can be used in a prefix or postfix manner.

    ```javascript
    let count = 5;
    count++; // count is now 6
    ```

7. **Decrement (`--`)**: This operator decreases the value of a variable by 1. Like the increment operator, it can be used in a prefix or postfix manner.

    ```javascript
    let count = 5;
    count--; // count is now 4
    ```

8. **Unary Negation (`-`)**: This operator converts the operand to Number type and negates it.

    ```javascript
    let x = '5';
    x = -x; // x is now -5
    ```

9. **Unary Plus (`+`)**: This operator attempts to convert the operand to a number, if it isn't already.

    ```javascript
    let x = '5';
    x = +x; // x is now 5 (a number)
    ```

10. **Exponentiation (`**`)**: This operator raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

    ```javascript
    let base = 2;
    let power = 3;
    let result = base ** power; // result is now 8
    ```

Remember, while using these operators, JavaScript will try to convert different data types to complete the operation, which might not always produce the expected result (especially with the addition operator and non-numeric data types). Therefore, it's always a good practice to ensure your data is of the correct type before performing arithmetic operations.
