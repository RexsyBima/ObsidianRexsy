Dot notation is one of the ways you can access or modify the properties of an object in JavaScript.

### Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
object.propertyName
```

Here, `object` is the name of the object, and `propertyName` is the name of the property you wish to access or modify. 

### Usage

Consider the following object:

```javascript
let car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2020
};
```

You can access the properties of this object using dot notation:

```javascript
console.log(car.brand);  // Outputs: "Toyota"
console.log(car.model);  // Outputs: "Camry"
console.log(car.year);   // Outputs: 2020
```

You can also modify the properties of an object using dot notation:

```javascript
car.year = 2021;
console.log(car.year);  // Outputs: 2021
```

Or you can add a new property to the object:

```javascript
car.color = "Red";
console.log(car.color);  // Outputs: "Red"
```

### Limitations

While dot notation is concise and easy to read, it has some limitations:

- You can't use dot notation to access or modify properties with names that are not valid JavaScript identifiers (e.g., property names that include spaces or special characters, or that start with a number).
- You can't use dot notation with a property name stored in a variable. 

For these cases, you would use bracket notation, which has a slightly more flexible syntax.

### Note 

Dot notation is also used in JavaScript for method chaining. For example:

```javascript
let greeting = "   Hello, World!   ";
console.log(greeting.trim().toUpperCase());  // Outputs: "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

Here, the `trim` method is called on the `greeting` string to remove whitespace, then the `toUpperCase` method is called on the result to convert the string to upper case.
