Declaring a variable without `let`, `var`, or `const` is generally considered bad practice in JavaScript due to the following reasons:

1. **Global Scope**: If you create a variable without `let`, `var`, or `const`, it automatically gets assigned to the global scope, regardless of where it was declared. This can lead to unexpected results, especially in larger codebases where variable names could unintentionally overlap.

    ```javascript
    function someFunction() {
        unwantedGlobal = 'This is bad';
    }

    someFunction();
    console.log(unwantedGlobal); // Outputs: 'This is bad'
    ```

    In the example above, even though `unwantedGlobal` was declared inside `someFunction`, it becomes globally accessible once the function is called. If there's another variable named `unwantedGlobal` elsewhere in the code, it would get overwritten.

2. **Lack of Block Scope**: Without `let` or `const`, a variable doesn't have block scope. This means that if a variable is declared inside an `if` statement or a loop without using `let`, `var`, or `const`, it's still accessible outside of that block.

    ```javascript
    if (true) {
        notBlockScoped = 'This is also bad';
    }

    console.log(notBlockScoped); // Outputs: 'This is also bad'
    ```

3. **Unintentional Variable Reassignments**: If you forget to declare a variable with `let`, `var`, or `const`, you could unintentionally create a new global variable when you meant to update an existing one. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues.

4. **Strict Mode**: In strict mode (`'use strict';`), creating variables without `let`, `var`, or `const` will actually result in an error. Strict mode is recommended for modern JavaScript development because it helps to catch common errors.

    ```javascript
    'use strict';

    strictModeVar = 'This will cause an error'; // Uncaught ReferenceError: strictModeVar is not defined
    ```

5. **No Variable Hoisting**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are not hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that they cannot be used before they are declared. Variables declared without `let`, `var`, or `const` don't follow this rule.

For all these reasons, it's recommended to always declare your variables with `let`, `var`, or `const` in JavaScript. It helps prevent bugs and makes your code more predictable and easier to understand.
