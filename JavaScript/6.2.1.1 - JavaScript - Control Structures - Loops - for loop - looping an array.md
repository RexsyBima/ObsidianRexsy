Using a `for` loop to iterate through an array is a common pattern in JavaScript. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
let myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];

for(let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i]);
}
```

Let's break down what's happening here:

1. `let i = 0;` - This initializes the loop counter (`i`) to `0`. In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at position `0`.

2. `i < myArray.length;` - This is the condition that the loop checks before each iteration. As long as `i` is less than the length of the array, the loop continues.

3. `i++` - This increments `i` by `1` after each iteration of the loop.

4. `console.log(myArray[i]);` - Inside the loop, this line accesses the `i`-th element of `myArray` and logs it to the console. As `i` increases, this results in each element of the array being logged in order.

This basic pattern of using a `for` loop to iterate over an array is very common in JavaScript, and you can replace `console.log(myArray[i]);` with any code you want to execute for each element of the array.
