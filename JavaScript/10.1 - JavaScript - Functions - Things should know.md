There's a lot more to learn about functions in JavaScript. Let's dive into a few more advanced concepts:

1. **Functions are Objects**: In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. This means they can have properties and methods, can be assigned to variables, can be passed as arguments to other functions, and can also be returned from other functions.

2. **Hoisting**: JavaScript has a behavior called "hoisting", where function and variable declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means you can use a function before it's declared in the code. However, this is not the case with function expressions or arrow functions.

```javascript
hoistedFunction(); // Works! Outputs: "This function has been hoisted"

function hoistedFunction() {
    console.log("This function has been hoisted");
}

notHoistedFunction(); // Error: notHoistedFunction is not a function

var notHoistedFunction = function() {
    console.log("This function has not been hoisted");
};
```

3. **Closure**: A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. This is a fundamental concept in JavaScript and is a key part of how functions work.

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log('outerVariable:', outerVariable);
        console.log('innerVariable:', innerVariable);
    }
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside'); // Logs: "outerVariable: outside" and "innerVariable: inside"
```

4. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

```javascript
(function () {
    console.log("This is an IIFE!");
})();
```

5. **Recursion**: A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. Be careful with recursion as it can lead to an infinite loop if not handled correctly.

```javascript
function countdown(num) {
    console.log(num);
    if(num > 0) {
        countdown(num - 1);
    }
}
countdown(5); // Logs: 5 4 3 2 1
```

6. **Default parameters**: From ES6/ES2015, functions can be defined with default parameter values. If no value or undefined is passed for that parameter, the default value will be used.

```javascript
function greet(name = "World") {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet(); // Logs: "Hello, World!"
greet("Reksy"); // Logs: "Hello, Reksy!"
```

These are more advanced topics and understanding these will definitely take you to the next level in JavaScript. Each of these topics is deep in itself and deserves separate, focused learning. Happy coding, Reksy!
