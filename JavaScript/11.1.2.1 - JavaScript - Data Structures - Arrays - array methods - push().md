Absolutely, Rexsy. Let's dive deeper into the `push()` method in JavaScript arrays.

The `push()` method is a built-in JavaScript method for arrays. It allows you to add one or more elements to the end of an array. It then returns the new length of the array.

Here is the syntax of the `push()` method:
```javascript
arr.push(element1[, ...[, elementN]])
```
You can pass one or more elements to the `push()` method. Each of the elements you pass to the `push()` method will be appended to the end of the array in the order that they appear.

Here is an example of usage:
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.push('mango');
console.log(fruits);  // Output: ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
console.log(fruits.length);  // Output: 3
```

In this example, we have an array called `fruits` that initially contains two elements: 'apple' and 'banana'. We then use the `push()` method to add 'mango' to the end of the array. When we print the array, we see that it now contains 'apple', 'banana', and 'mango'. When we print the length of the array, it returns 3, which is the new length of the array after the 'mango' was added.

One thing to note is that the `push()` method modifies the original array. If you want to add an element to an array without modifying the original array, you would need to create a new array or use a method like `concat()` which does not modify the original array.

Also, you can push multiple elements at once:
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.push('mango', 'pineapple', 'grape');
console.log(fruits);  
// Output: ["apple", "banana", "mango", "pineapple", "grape"]
```
In this case, 'mango', 'pineapple', and 'grape' are all added to the end of the `fruits` array in that order.
