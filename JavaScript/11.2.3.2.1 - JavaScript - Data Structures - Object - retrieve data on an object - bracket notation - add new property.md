Using the bracket notation to add a property to an object in JavaScript is quite straightforward. Here's how you do it:

```javascript
let student = {};

student["name"] = "John";
student["age"] = 21;
student["grade"] = "Senior";
```

Here, we have created an empty object `student`, then added properties `name`, `age`, and `grade` to it.

You can also add methods using the bracket notation:

```javascript
student["introduce"] = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am a ${this.grade}`);
};
```

This adds a method named `introduce` to the `student` object, which when called will print out a short introduction. Here's how you call it:

```javascript
student["introduce"]();
```

The bracket notation is particularly useful when you want to use variables as property names or if the property name includes spaces, special characters, or starts with a number, as these would not be possible with dot notation.

```javascript
let property = "hobby";
student[property] = "Reading"; // The property name is determined by the value of the variable

student["favorite book"] = "1984"; // Property name includes a space
```

The `property` variable in this example holds the string `"hobby"`. When it's used in bracket notation, JavaScript will look at its value and use that as the property name. Thus, `student[property] = "Reading"` is the same as `student["hobby"] = "Reading"` in this context.
