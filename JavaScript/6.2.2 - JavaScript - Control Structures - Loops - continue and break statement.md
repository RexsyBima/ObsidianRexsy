### `continue` statement
The `continue` statement in JavaScript is used to "skip" one iteration in the loop. If the `continue` statement is executed, control jumps to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any code below it.

Here's an example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

In this code, when `i` equals 5, the `continue` statement is executed. This means that the loop skips the `console.log(i)` statement for this iteration and moves directly to the next iteration (`i = 6`). So, the console will log the numbers 0 through 4, skip number 5, and then log numbers 6 through 9.

Note that `continue` only skips the current iteration of the loop. If you want to break out of the loop completely, you would use the `break` statement instead.

Also, it's worth mentioning that you can use `continue` with any type of loop in JavaScript (`for`, `while`, or `do...while`), not just `for` loops.

### `break` statement
The `break` statement in JavaScript is used to "break out" of a loop. This means that if the `break` statement is executed, the loop stops running and control moves to the next line of code after the loop. Here's an example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
```

In this code, when `i` equals 5, the `break` statement is executed. This means the loop stops completely, and no further iterations are performed. The console will log the numbers 0 through 4, then stop.

Here's a key difference between `break` and `continue`: 

- `break` stops the entire loop prematurely.
- `continue` only skips the current iteration and the loop continues with the next iteration.

Also, like `continue`, you can use `break` with any type of loop in JavaScript (`for`, `while`, or `do...while`), not just `for` loops.
