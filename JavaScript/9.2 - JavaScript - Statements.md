Absolutely, Rexsy! JavaScript statements are instructions to be executed by the web browser.

Here are some examples of the various types of statements in JavaScript:

1. **Variable Declaration Statements:** In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

    ```javascript
    var x = 5;
    let y = 6;
    const z = 7;
    ```

2. **Assignment Statements:** You can assign values to variables using the `=` operator.

    ```javascript
    x = 10;
    y = 20;
    ```

3. **Function Declaration Statements:** In JavaScript, you can declare a function using the `function` keyword.

    ```javascript
    function sayHello() {
        console.log("Hello, Rexsy!");
    }
    ```

4. **Control Flow Statements:** These include `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, and `throw`.

    ```javascript
    if (x > y) {
        console.log("x is greater than y");
    } else {
        console.log("x is not greater than y");
    }

    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

    function add(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    ```

5. **Expression Statements:** An expression statement is a valid expression followed by a semicolon (`;`). 

    ```javascript
    x * y;
    'Hello, Rexsy!';
    ```

Remember, JavaScript is a statement-oriented language. Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements where each statement is executed by the web browser in the sequence they were written. Each statement is separated by a semicolon.

Also, JavaScript is case sensitive. The keyword `let`, for example, must be typed in lowercase because `Let` or `LET` will not be recognized as a keyword.

It's important to understand these statements as they're the building blocks of your JavaScript code. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions on JavaScript statements!
