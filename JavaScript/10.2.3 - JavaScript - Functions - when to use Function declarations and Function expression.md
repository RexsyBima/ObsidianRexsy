### **Function Declarations** are generally used when:

- You want to create a function that is hoisted, meaning you can call it before it is defined in the code.
- The function is a fundamental piece of your code and it represents a behavior that you wish to describe independently of any variable assignments or other runtime conditions.

### **Function Expressions** are generally used when:

- You're assigning a function as a callback.
- You want to use an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) for managing local scope.
- You're defining a function that won't be reused elsewhere, such as an event handler or a function assigned to a variable.
- You're passing a function as an argument to another function.

Each method has its place in JavaScript coding and you can often use either interchangeably without a significant impact on your code's performance or behavior. However, understanding the differences can help you make more informed decisions when writing your functions.
