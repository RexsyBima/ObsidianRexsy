A loop inside another loop is known as a nested loop. It is quite common in programming, especially when you're working with multi-dimensional arrays or when you want to compare elements of an array with each other. 

Here's an example of a nested loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { 
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) { 
        console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
    }
}
```

In this example, for each iteration of the outer loop (where `i` goes from 0 to 2), the inner loop runs completely (where `j` goes from 0 to 1). So the output will be:

```
i: 0, j: 0
i: 0, j: 1
i: 1, j: 0
i: 1, j: 1
i: 2, j: 0
i: 2, j: 1
```

Nested loops can be very useful, but they can also lead to high computational complexity if not used wisely. That's because the total number of iterations is the product of the number of iterations of the outer and inner loops. So if both loops run from 1 to N, there will be N*N = N^2 iterations, which can be quite large if N is large. 

In other words, you should be careful not to create nested loops that run for many iterations, as this can slow down your program significantly.
