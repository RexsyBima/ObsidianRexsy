In JavaScript, there are several ways to output or log data for debugging purposes. The most common method is using `console.log()`. However, there are additional methods in the `console` object that are also quite useful.

1. **`console.log()`**: This is the most used method for outputting data to the console.

   ```javascript
   console.log('Hello, Rexsy!');
   ```

2. **`console.info()`**: This is generally used for informational purposes. It's identical to `console.log()` in modern browsers.

   ```javascript
   console.info('This is some information');
   ```

3. **`console.warn()`**: This outputs a warning message to the console. In many browsers, the output will be highlighted with a yellow background.

   ```javascript
   console.warn('This is a warning');
   ```

4. **`console.error()`**: This outputs an error message. In many browsers, the output will be highlighted with a red background.

   ```javascript
   console.error('This is an error');
   ```

5. **`console.table()`**: This method allows you to display data in the console in a tabular format. It's extremely useful when working with arrays of objects.

   ```javascript
   console.table([{name: 'Rexsy', age: 25}, {name: 'Alex', age: 30}]);
   ```

6. **`console.assert()`**: This method writes an error message to the console if the assertion is `false`. If the assertion is `true`, nothing happens.

   ```javascript
   console.assert(1 === 2, 'This is wrong!');
   ```

Remember, `console` methods are mostly used for debugging purposes and you shouldn't use them as a part of your final, production-ready code. They can be especially handy while developing, as you can log any data and see the output in the browser's JavaScript console.
