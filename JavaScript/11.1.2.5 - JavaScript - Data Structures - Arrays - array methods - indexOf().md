Absolutely, Rexsy. The `indexOf()` method is a very useful array method in JavaScript.

The `indexOf()` method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. 

Here is the basic syntax for `indexOf()`:

```javascript
arr.indexOf(item, start)
```

- `item`: Required. The item to search for.
- `start`: Optional. Where to start the search. Negative values will start at the given position counting from the end, and default is 0.

Here's an example of how you might use `indexOf()`:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango', 'apple'];
let bananaIndex = fruits.indexOf('banana');

console.log(bananaIndex); // Output: 1
```

In this example, calling `indexOf('banana')` on the `fruits` array returns 1, because 'banana' is at index 1 in the array. 

If the element is not found, `indexOf()` returns -1. Also, if the item occurs more than once, `indexOf()` only returns the position of the first occurrence. If you need the position of the last occurrence, you can use `lastIndexOf()`.

```javascript
let appleIndex = fruits.indexOf('apple'); // Output: 0, not 3
let orangeIndex = fruits.indexOf('orange'); // Output: -1, 'orange' is not in the array
```

In JavaScript, array indices are zero-based, meaning the first item is at index 0, the second item is at index 1, and so on.
