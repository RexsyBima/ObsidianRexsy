 **Anonymous function** is a function that is not given a name when it is defined. They can be used wherever function expressions are expected. Here are some examples of anonymous functions:

```javascript
// As a function expression
let sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

sayHello(); // "Hello, world!"
```

```javascript
// As a parameter to another function (often used in callback patterns)
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This is an anonymous function callback.");
}, 1000);
```

```javascript
// As an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
(function() {
  console.log("This is an anonymous function that is immediately invoked!");
})();
```

In each of these examples, the function is defined without a name, hence the term "anonymous function."

**Some things to note:**

1. **Debugging:** One downside to using anonymous functions is that they can make debugging more difficult. Since they have no name, the JavaScript debugger will not be able to display the function name in the stack trace, which can make your code harder to debug.

2. **Reuse:** If you intend to use a function in multiple places, it's better to give it a name and declare it as a named function or a function expression with a variable name.

3. **Readability:** Named functions can make your code more readable, as the function name can provide a hint about what the function does.

It's also worth noting that with the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), arrow functions, which are always anonymous, have become more popular due to their shorter syntax and unique handling of the `this` keyword.
