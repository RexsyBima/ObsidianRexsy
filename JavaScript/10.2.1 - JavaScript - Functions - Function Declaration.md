Function declaration is one of the primary ways to create a function in JavaScript. Here's an overview:

### Function Declarations

In JavaScript, function declarations are defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function, a pair of parentheses that may include parameter names, and then a pair of curly braces `{}` that enclose the function body.

Here is the syntax of a function declaration:

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
  // function body
}
```

Let's break this down:

- `function`: This keyword starts the declaration.
- `functionName`: This is the name of the function. You can use this to call the function later.
- `parameters`: These are inputs to the function. You can pass values into a function using parameters. These are optional, and a function can have any number of parameters.
- `// function body`: This is where you write your block of code. This is the task that your function will perform every time it is called.

Here's a concrete example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

// Now we can call the function
greet('Reksy'); // Outputs: Hello, Reksy!
```

#### Note about Hoisting

Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that you can call a function before you declare it in your code:

```javascript
// We're calling the function before it's declared
sayHello('Reksy'); // This will still work, Outputs: Hello, Reksy!

// Now we declare the function
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

This behavior is unique to function declarations in JavaScript and does not apply to function expressions or arrow functions.

Remember, functions are an essential part of JavaScript. They allow you to write reusable code, simplify your programs, and manage your code more efficiently.
