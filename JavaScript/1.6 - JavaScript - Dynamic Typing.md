In JavaScript, variables are dynamically typed. This means you don't have to specify what type of data a variable will hold when you declare it. The JavaScript engine will automatically determine the data type of a variable at runtime (i.e., as the code is executing), hence the term "dynamic typing". This is different from statically typed languages like Java or C++, where you must specify the data type when you declare a variable.

Here's an example to demonstrate this:

```javascript
let myVariable = "Hello, Rexsy"; // At this point, myVariable is a string
console.log(typeof myVariable); // Outputs: "string"

myVariable = 42; // Now myVariable is a number
console.log(typeof myVariable); // Outputs: "number"

myVariable = true; // Now myVariable is a boolean
console.log(typeof myVariable); // Outputs: "boolean"

myVariable = { name: "Rexsy" }; // Now myVariable is an object
console.log(typeof myVariable); // Outputs: "object"
```

As you can see, the same variable (`myVariable`) was able to hold different types of data at different points in time, and JavaScript was able to handle this just fine. This is dynamic typing in action!

However, while dynamic typing provides flexibility, it can also lead to errors if you're not careful. For instance, if you try to perform an operation that's not valid for the current data type of a variable, you'll get a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

Let's consider the following example:

```javascript
let x = 5; // x is a number
let y = x / 2; // y is now 2.5, which is perfectly fine

x = "Hello, Rexsy"; // x is now a string
y = x / 2; // What does it mean to divide a string by 2? JavaScript returns NaN (Not a Number)
```

In the above case, we didn't get an error, but `y` became `NaN` after the operation, which might not be what we expected. So while dynamic typing can be powerful and flexible, it's also crucial to understand how it works to avoid potential pitfalls.
