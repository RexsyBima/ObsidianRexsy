Sure, let's explore the string operators in JavaScript. Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript has only one string operator: the `+` operator. The `+` operator can be used in two ways:

1. **Concatenation (`+`)**: The `+` operator can be used to add (or concatenate) two strings together.

    ```javascript
    let firstName = "John";
    let lastName = "Doe";
    let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"
    ```

2. **Concatenation assignment (`+=`)**: The `+=` operator can be used to add (or concatenate) a string onto the end of an existing string.

    ```javascript
    let message = "Hello";
    message += " World"; // "Hello World"
    ```

When used with strings, the `+` operator is called the concatenation operator.

Additionally, the `+` operator can be used to convert non-string values to strings:

```javascript
let value = 5 + "10"; // "510"
```

In the above example, the Number `5` is converted to a string and concatenated with the string `"10"`, resulting in the string `"510"`.

Be aware that when you use operators in JavaScript with mixed number and string values, the result might not be what you expect. For example, `"5" + 2` will result in `"52"`, not `7`. This is because the `+` operator is also the string concatenation operator, and string concatenation takes precedence over numeric addition, so the Number `2` gets converted to a string.

To avoid confusion, it's always a good practice to make sure you're working with the right data types. If you want to perform arithmetic operations, make sure your data is Number data types. If you want to perform string concatenation, make sure your data is String data types.
