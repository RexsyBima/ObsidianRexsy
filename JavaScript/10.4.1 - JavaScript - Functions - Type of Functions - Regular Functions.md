 **Regular function** is the most basic and traditional form of a function in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of what regular functions are, how they are structured, and how they work:

1. **Declaration:** A regular function is declared using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name. The function name should be descriptive of what the function does, in line with the naming conventions of your project or team.

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

2. **Parameters and Arguments:** A function can take parameters, which are variables that will be used in the function's operations. When you call a function and pass values into it, these values are called arguments. The parameters are used to capture these arguments in the function declaration.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Rexsy"); // "Rexsy" is the argument here
```

3. **Return Values:** A function can produce a value that can be used elsewhere in your code. This is done with the `return` keyword. Once a return statement is executed, the function stops running and gives back (returns) the value. If there is no return statement, the function will return `undefined` by default.

```javascript
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
let sum = addNumbers(2, 3); // sum is now 5
```

4. **Function Scope:** Each function has its own scope, which is the context in which variables are declared. Variables declared inside a function cannot be accessed outside of it.

```javascript
function showLocalVariable() {
  let local = "I'm local";
  console.log(local);
}
showLocalVariable(); // logs "I'm local"
console.log(local); // throws ReferenceError: local is not defined
```

5. **Hoisting:** Function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, which means they can be called before they are declared in the code.

```javascript
sayHello(); // logs "Hello, world!"
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

Remember, regular functions are just one type of function in JavaScript. Depending on your use case, you might choose to use other types, like arrow functions, methods, constructor functions, or IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).
