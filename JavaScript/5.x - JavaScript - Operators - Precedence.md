In JavaScript, as in many programming languages, operator precedence determines how operations are grouped in the absence of parentheses. Here's an overview of some of the levels of precedence (from highest to lowest):

1. **Grouping `()`**: Used to change the precedence or order of evaluation of expressions.

    ```javascript
    let result = 3 * (4 + 2); // 18
    ```

2. **Increment (`++`), Decrement (`--`)**: The prefix versions of these have higher precedence than most other operators.

    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = ++x * 2; // y is 12, x is 6
    ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Remainder (`%`)**: These have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right.

    ```javascript
    let result = 3 * 4 / 2; // 6
    ```

4. **Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`)**: These have equal precedence and are evaluated from left to right.

    ```javascript
    let result = 5 + 3 - 2; // 6
    ```

5. **Less Than (`<`), Less Than or Equal To (`<=`), Greater Than (`>`), Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: These comparison operators have equal precedence.

    ```javascript
    let isTrue = 5 < 8 > 4; // false
    ```

6. **Equality (`==`), Inequality (`!=`), Strict Equality (`===`), Strict Inequality (`!==`)**: These have equal precedence.

    ```javascript
    let isEqual = 5 == '5'; // true
    let isStrictlyEqual = 5 === '5'; // false
    ```

7. **Logical AND (`&&`)**: This is lower than the equality and inequality operators.

    ```javascript
    let result = false && true; // false
    ```

8. **Logical OR (`||`)**: This is lower than the logical AND operator.

    ```javascript
    let result = false || true; // true
    ```

9. **Conditional operator (`? :`)**: This has lower precedence than logical OR.

    ```javascript
    let isAdult = age >= 18 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
    ```

10. **Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.)**: These have the lowest precedence.

    ```javascript
    let x = 5;
    let y = x = 1; // x and y are both 1
    ```

When in doubt, you can always use parentheses to ensure operations are carried out in the order you want. They increase readability and reduce the likelihood of errors.
