In JavaScript, bracket notation is an alternate way to access object properties. It is more flexible than dot notation and can handle a wider range of property names. 

### Syntax

The syntax for bracket notation is:

```javascript
object["propertyName"]
```

Here, `object` is the name of the object, and `"propertyName"` is a string representing the name of the property you wish to access or modify. Note that the property name is enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes).

### Usage

Here's an example using the same `car` object:

```javascript
let car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2020
};

console.log(car["brand"]);  // Outputs: "Toyota"
console.log(car["model"]);  // Outputs: "Camry"
console.log(car["year"]);   // Outputs: 2020
```

### Flexibility

One advantage of bracket notation is that it can handle property names that aren't valid JavaScript identifiers. For example, if a property name includes spaces or special characters, or starts with a number, you can still access it using bracket notation:

```javascript
let person = {
    "first name": "John",
    "last name": "Doe",
    "age": 30
};

console.log(person["first name"]);  // Outputs: "John"
console.log(person["last name"]);   // Outputs: "Doe"
console.log(person["age"]);         // Outputs: 30
```

### Variables in Property Names

Another advantage of bracket notation is that it allows you to use a variable for the property name. This can be very useful in certain programming situations. Here's an example:

```javascript
let propName = "brand";
console.log(car[propName]);  // Outputs: "Toyota"
```

In this example, `propName` is a variable that holds the string `"brand"`. When `propName` is used in bracket notation, JavaScript uses the *value* of `propName` (not the literal string `"propName"`) as the property name.

### Note

While bracket notation is very flexible, it is also more verbose than dot notation. As a general rule, use dot notation when you can, and switch to bracket notation when you need to handle more complex property names or use variables in property names.
