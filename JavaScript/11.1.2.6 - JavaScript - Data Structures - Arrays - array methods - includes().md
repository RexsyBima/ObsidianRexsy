Sure, Rexsy. The `includes()` method is another useful array method in JavaScript.

The `includes()` method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or `false` as appropriate. This can be very useful for simple checks to see if a certain value is in the array.

Here's the basic syntax for `includes()`:

```javascript
arr.includes(valueToFind, fromIndex)
```

- `valueToFind`: Required. The value to search for.
- `fromIndex`: Optional. The position in this array at which to begin searching for `valueToFind`. The default is 0.

Here's an example of how you might use `includes()`:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango'];
console.log(fruits.includes('banana')); // Output: true
console.log(fruits.includes('grape'));  // Output: false
```

In this example, calling `includes('banana')` on the `fruits` array returns `true` because 'banana' is in the array. On the other hand, calling `includes('grape')` returns `false` because 'grape' is not in the array.

Note that `includes()` method is case sensitive. 'banana' and 'Banana' would be considered different values.

Also note, `includes()` can also be used with `fromIndex`. If `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, `false` is returned, meaning the array will not be searched:

```javascript
console.log(fruits.includes('banana', 3)); // Output: false
```

In this case, the search for 'banana' starts at index position 3, and since there is no such position in the array (it's beyond the array's length), it returns `false`.
