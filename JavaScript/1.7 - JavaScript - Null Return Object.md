 This behavior is actually a well-known bug in JavaScript that has persisted for historical reasons. When JavaScript was first created, values were represented by a type tag and the actual value. The type tag for objects was 0, and null was represented as the "NULL pointer", which was 0. So, null, being a falsy value, had a representation that made it seem like an object.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
let myVar = null;
console.log(typeof myVar); // Outputs: "object"
```

Despite the output of `typeof` for `null` being `"object"`, `null` is not actually an object. It's a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. In practical terms, `null` is often used to represent or initialize a variable that is intended to eventually hold an object.

This bug has never been fixed because doing so could break existing code that relies on this quirky behavior. Instead, developers have to be aware of this special case. If you want to check whether a value is `null`, you can do an equality (`==`) or strict equality (`===`) check:

```javascript
let myVar = null;

if (myVar === null) {
  console.log('myVar is null!');
} else {
  console.log('myVar is not null!');
}
```

In the above code, the message `"myVar is null!"` will be printed to the console.
