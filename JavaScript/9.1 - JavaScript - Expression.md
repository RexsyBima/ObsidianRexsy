In JavaScript, an expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

There are two types of expressions:

1. **Arithmetic Expressions:** These compute a numeric value or perform an operation that results in a number. Examples include `5`, `3 + 4`, `x * y`, or `2 + 3 * 5`. 

2. **String Expressions:** These compute a string or perform an operation that results in a string. Examples include `'Hello, World'`, `'Hello' + 'World'`, or `name + 'Smith'`.

Let's dive deeper into some more specific types of expressions:

**Literal Value Expression**

This is the simplest type of expression, where values are simply hard-coded into your script:

```javascript
// Numeric literal
let num = 3.15;
// String literal
let str = 'Hello, Rexsy!';
```

**Variable Expression**

A variable expression refers to the value of a variable:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = x;  // y is now equal to 5
```

**Binary Expression**

A binary expression uses an operator to act on two expressions:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let sum = x + y;  // sum is now equal to 15
```

**Logical Expression**

Logical expressions combine two or more expressions, resulting in a Boolean value. Examples of operators in logical expressions include `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not):

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let isXGreaterThanY = x > y;  // false
```

**Function Call Expression**

This expression calls a function and uses its return value:

```javascript
let x = Math.sqrt(16);  // x is now equal to 4
```

**Conditional (Ternary) Expression**

This is a short way to write an if-else statement. It takes the form `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`:

```javascript
let isAdult = (age >= 18) ? 'Yes' : 'No';
```

Remember that JavaScript is an expression-oriented language, meaning you can usually use an expression anywhere a statement is expected. This allows for concise and flexible code. But do be careful not to make your code too dense, which can make it harder to read and maintain!
