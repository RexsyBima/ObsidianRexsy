The dot notation in JavaScript is a very direct way to access or assign a property to an object. If you want to add a new property to an object, you can use dot notation like so:

```javascript
let student = {};

student.name = "John";
student.age = 21;
student.grade = "Senior";
```

Here, we've created an empty object `student`, then added properties `name`, `age`, and `grade` to it.

You can even add methods (functions associated with an object) with dot notation:

```javascript
student.introduce = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am a ${this.grade}`);
};
```

This will add a method named `introduce` to the `student` object, which when called will print out a short introduction. Here's how you'd call it:

```javascript
student.introduce();
```

Just remember, when creating properties via dot notation, the property names cannot have spaces and special characters, and it cannot begin with a number. This is why the bracket notation is used when we need to add such property names.
