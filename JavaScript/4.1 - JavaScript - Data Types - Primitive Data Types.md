JavaScript has several types of primitive data, each of which represents a different kind of value that can be used in your code. Here's a deeper look into each type:

1. **Number:** The `number` data type can be used to represent both integers and floating-point (decimal) numbers. For example:

   ```javascript
   let num1 = 25;      // an integer
   let num2 = 80.75;   // a floating-point number
   ```

   Additionally, there are some special `number` values like `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not a Number).

2. **String:** The `string` data type is used to represent text data. Strings in JavaScript are surrounded by either single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`).

   ```javascript
   let str1 = 'hello';  // using single quotes
   let str2 = "world";  // using double quotes
   let str3 = `hello, ${str2}`;  // using backticks for string interpolation
   ```

3. **Boolean:** The `boolean` data type represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`.

   ```javascript
   let isReading = true;  // yes, I'm reading
   let isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
   ```

4. **Undefined:** A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value is `undefined`.

   ```javascript
   let someVar;
   console.log(someVar);  // undefined
   ```

5. **Null:** This is a special keyword denoting a null value. It means 'no value' or 'no object'. It is important to note that it is not the same as an undefined variable that has no value assigned.

   ```javascript
   let someVar = null;
   console.log(someVar);  // null
   ```

6. **BigInt:** This data type was introduced in newer versions of JavaScript (ES2020) to handle arbitrarily large integers. Any integer that is followed by `n` is a `BigInt`.

   ```javascript
   let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
   ```

7. **Symbol:** Introduced in ES6, the `symbol` data type is used to create anonymous and unique property identifiers that won't conflict with other properties on an object. 

   ```javascript
   let sym1 = Symbol('my_symbol');
   let sym2 = Symbol('my_symbol');
   console.log(sym1 === sym2);  // false
   ```

   Even though `sym1` and `sym2` have the same description ('my_symbol'), they are different symbols and the comparison returns `false`.

Each of these data types has its own specific properties and behaviors, and understanding them is crucial to using JavaScript effectively. Additionally, everything that is not a primitive 
type is considered an `object` in JavaScript, including functions and arrays.
