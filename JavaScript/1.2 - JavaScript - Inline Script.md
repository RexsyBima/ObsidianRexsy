An inline script in JavaScript refers to script code placed directly within the HTML document, usually within the `<script>` tag. Here's an example of an inline script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>A Web Page</h1>

<p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>

<script>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "This is a different paragraph!";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the JavaScript code directly manipulates the DOM to change the text within the paragraph element with the id "demo".

While inline scripts are straightforward and may suffice for very small scripts, they come with several downsides:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Inline scripts mix JavaScript and HTML, which goes against the principle of separation of concerns. Ideally, HTML (markup), CSS (styles), and JavaScript (behavior) should be kept in separate files.

2. **Caching:** Inline scripts cannot be cached by the browser. If you have the same script used in different pages, keeping the script in an external file allows the browser to cache it, resulting in faster subsequent page loads.

3. **Reusability:** JavaScript functions defined in inline scripts are not reusable across different HTML files.

4. **Maintenance:** It's harder to manage and maintain JavaScript code when it's sprinkled throughout the HTML file in inline scripts.

Because of these reasons, it's generally recommended to place JavaScript in external files whenever possible, linking to them in the HTML document using the `src` attribute in the `<script>` tag. However, inline scripts can still be used for small, page-specific scripts when necessary.

Lastly, it's also worth noting that due to security concerns, some Content Security Policies (CSP) may disallow the use of inline scripts.
