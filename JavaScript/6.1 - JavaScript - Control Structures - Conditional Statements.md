Conditional statements are a key aspect of JavaScript (or indeed, any programming language). They are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. In JavaScript, we have several types of conditional statements:

1. **`if` Statement:** This is the most simple form of a conditional statement. It checks if a condition is `true`. If the condition is `true`, the code within the block is executed.

```javascript
let a = 10;
if (a > 5) {
  console.log("a is greater than 5");
}
```

2. **`else` Statement:** This is used along with an `if` statement. If the `if` condition is `false`, then the code inside the `else` block is executed.

```javascript
let a = 10;
if (a > 15) {
  console.log("a is greater than 15");
} else {
  console.log("a is not greater than 15");
}
```

3. **`else if` Statement:** This is used when you want to test multiple conditions. If the condition in the `if` statement is `false`, it will move on to the `else if` statement, and so on. If none of the `if` or `else if` conditions are met, it executes the code in the `else` block (if present).

```javascript
let a = 10;
if (a > 15) {
  console.log("a is greater than 15");
} else if (a > 5) {
  console.log("a is greater than 5 but not greater than 15");
} else {
  console.log("a is not greater than 5");
}
```

4. **Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):** This is a shorthand way to write simple `if-else` statements. It takes three operands: a condition, an expression to execute if the condition is `true`, and an expression to execute if the condition is `false`.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let result = a > 5 ? "a is greater than 5" : "a is not greater than 5";
console.log(result);
```

5. **`switch` Statement:** This is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The `switch` statement evaluates an expression and matches the expression's value to a `case` clause. If a match is found, the code within that `case` (and all cases that follow) are executed until a `break` statement is encountered.

```javascript
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
  case "banana":
    console.log("I am a banana.");
    break;
  case "apple":
    console.log("I am an apple.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I am not a banana or an apple.");
}
```

Remember that for `if`, `else if` and `else`, the conditions must be written in parentheses, and the code to be executed in case the condition is true must be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`. For the ternary operator, no brackets are necessary but the two possible outcomes need to be separated by `:`. For the `switch` statement, each case is written without parentheses and ended with a `:`. The code for each case is enclosed in `{}` and it is common to end each case with a `break` statement to ensure that only the matched case is executed, not all the ones that follow.

Each of these conditional statements can be used according to your needs in the program. They are a fundamental aspect of controlling the logic and flow of your code.
