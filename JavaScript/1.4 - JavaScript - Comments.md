In JavaScript, there are two main types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

**1. Single-Line Comments**

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). JavaScript engines ignore any text to the right of the `//` on the same line. In VS Code, you can do this by using `ctrl + / `Here's an example:

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // You can also put comments after code
```

**2. Multi-Line Comments**

Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk (`/*`), and end with an asterisk and a forward slash (`*/`). Anything between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript. Here's an example:

```javascript
/* This is a multi-line comment.
   You can write as many lines as you want.
   These lines will be ignored by JavaScript */
let x = 5;
```

Comments are an important part of programming. They help other developers (and you when you return to your code at a later date) understand what your code is doing and why you made certain choices. Keep in mind, however, that excessive commenting or explaining every line of code can be just as confusing as no comments at all. The goal should be to strike a balance and only explain what's necessary and not immediately obvious from the code itself.
