In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is a special identifier that's automatically defined in the scope of every function and it usually refers to something that's called a "context".

In the context of an object, `this` refers to the object itself. More specifically, in methods (which are functions that belong to objects), `this` refers to the object that the method is a property of.

For example, consider the following object:

```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};
```

In the `fullName` method of the `person` object, `this` refers to the `person` object itself. Therefore, `this.firstName` refers to the `firstName` property of the `person` object, and `this.lastName` refers to the `lastName` property of the `person` object.

When you call the `person.fullName()` method, it will return "John Doe". This is because `this.firstName` returns "John" and `this.lastName` returns "Doe".

It's important to note that the value of `this` is determined at runtime, when a function is called, and it's not set when a function is defined. The value of `this` can be different depending on how a function is called. In particular, in event handlers, `this` usually refers to the HTML element that received the event.
